Also has stylus support with an S Pen, Fold Edition or Pro.  The Pro has many more features than the Apple Pencil, thanks to Bluetooth and location ability.  Also controls the camera remotely and media."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"You forgot one category.  The ethics and environmental record of the companies. I understand that most tech reviewers care not about anything but specs and features, but there is a real human cost to consider when purchasing products.  This is why in my many years as a tech purchaser for Govt there are some big brands that get left behind after the first round."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Why does it using the Google fold for the Android phone? 
Both have their pro’s and cons. 
iOS has too many lockdowns but easy to use. iCloud has many built in features that work in conjunction with the iPhone and iPad and easy to use. 
I’m looking at one of the fold phones. Because I could leave my iPad at home. Problem is I’ve invested into too much Apple eco system. Ugh"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I don't why but value for money/pricing wasn't a category considered here, considering the fact that it would be an important factor for a lot of people...and we all know which side would have won that."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I switched to Android last may. I've owned iPhones almost my whole life. My first was a Samsung solstice. But after that it was the iPhone 4s. I started to get really irritated with apple because they kept taking away features and asking for more money. I'm still pissed they took away the aux port. And in the last like 5 years they are adding almost nothing to the phone each year and asking for more money. Android had everything I wanted the switch I just avoided because I didn't want to start over. But Android plays nice with apple. Apple does NOT play nice with Android. You can get apple apps on Android. Including things like apple music.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,...the winners are the multibillion dollar tech companies selling you shitty overpriced phones while harvesting all your data and selling it to advertisers.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Love that you have to ignore massive advantages in 2 categories, make a direct opposition category of customization, and ignore the quality of updates in the update section.
How are you going to ignore the most important aspects of apps and ecosystems, freedom, all in favor of ease of use. Why does the ease of use category exist when your argument for 3/7 categories is centered around ease of use. You say apple has a better ecosystem while ignoring the most important aspect, availability. If you yourself say that they are equal in seperate devices, then souldnt the winner be determined by how many devices are compatible with each ecosystem? If you talk about updates, then shouldn't you take about the quality of updates? It doesn't matter how long they get updated for, all that matters is how active and impactful those updated are
Also, why does the ease of use category exist, it is literally just an anti customization category.

I came into this expecting a rational objective breakdown, and instead I saw blatant ignorance of information and contradictory categories and statements."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I've been using Motorola Edge 2021 for the last 3 years and have had zero problems. I just hate how big it is. Now I'm looking at the iPhone 15  but it seems like a downgrade in battery life. Any suggestions?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I had an iPod and iPad because that’s what was the best back in 2012-2013. Got my first good android (s3) and found out about custom roms and basically got rid of my apple products right after. After about 10 years finally got an iPhone and yes there’s some things I like but overall I hate it so much. It’s super buggy. The cameras don’t perform on my iPhone 13 Pro Max as well as my budget phone s20 fe which wasn’t close to top of the line and is older. I’m constantly annoyed with my iPhone. I can’t wait to upgrade my android phone and could care less about upgrading the iphone

Trying so much to pretend to be impartial but always chosing Apple (no, ""giving an edge"" to Android when Android is miles ahead is stupid). HYPE ON iPHONE? 15 was a copy&paste of 14! LOL.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"From what I feel and how I draw a parallel between these two brands, it’s like Bentley and Lexus. I like both the cars but on a Bentley doesn’t expect all those features of Lexus. Different vibes altogether and different class!! 😊"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Thanks for the video Marquez. I didn’t realize you’d actually do it.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I don’t think I’ll be buying another iPhone. The charging ports are terrible and the chargers are shit. Not to mention if a cat sneezes on them you’ve got a shattered screen. Way overpriced and overrated.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The best in everything is always subjective. They are both good in their own way. My take on this is that Android is for people who like personalizing things on their phones. iPhones are for people who want refined and simple phone. The year 2024 is the peak of mobile phones.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Not entirely sure about your system: I own Androids since ever. I am then drawn into Customization Features and Excitements, Android brought that to us. So according to your system I will always be Android. But when I now see the seamless integration of devices within the Apple ecosystem (say Air Drop Iphone to Macbook way back when) I'm tempted to switch to get these features. Would be an expensive switch though. Anyway, great video as usual"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me iPhone winner  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"For Apps Android is better,You can sideload it,I could download apps for free in google where in Play store i had to pay it

The only thing i love about iPhones is that it says longer for its smoothness like it doesnt get Laggy easily unlike Androids(This could be false since im talking about this from my experience when i was young,I had a Samsung tablet and it got laggy easily and then i got an Apple Ipad it stayed longer but still got laggy,I dont know if this is still true)

And there is another thing that i remember about my old Apple iPad which was ios 9 and i could update it up to ios 10.3 and then i didnt get any updates and then later to download YouTube you need to have ios 11 and above which i couldnt download it and i had to use Safari to watch YouTube which was pain"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Hey dude, where on the Iphone is the ' BACK'  button? and how many steps do you make to find the current date? You are an Apple user/fan, and I don't want to spend two months income on a piece of tech from Apple. But, your opinion and mine are different."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Tried switching from Asus Zenfone 8 to iPhone 13 Pro
My deal breaker from iPhone is :
1. Doesnt even have access File Manager. My work requires a lot of back to back File access
2. No finger print. I tried to open my iPhone in the dark and it can't read my face. Even tho my pin is only 4 number short, it's really anoying. I mean, c'mon, my brother have $200 realme phone and finger-print sensor works fast as hell.
3. Battery life. Tried switching from 1 time charge a day phone to 2-3 times charge a day it feels like a freakin joke. I almost never bring my charger to my office with Zenfone and with iPhone I have to bring it everywhere. 
At this point I finally understand why iPhone user always carry small bag everywhere they goes, to store their charger and power bank.
4. Slow charging. Imagine switching from Asus HyperCharge speed 70% in 20 minutes which can fit for my entire day activity to 60% in 45 minutes, it almost drives me crazy"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"18:05 yah, tell that to Huawei ... and others,  they compete until an outsider is about to win, why do you think Samsung dont push too much?
also Ecosystem is only in US, the rest of the world is out there and is out of that to so uno revers ?"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Apps one is clearly a android W.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"man I had apple everything for a long time, but I been a droid boy for about ten years now.  and you know what really strikes me?  Granny Smith was always my favorite apple."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Just have both and be happy.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"My Moto Android cost me £70 brand new. And it does everything I want it to do.
Yes, sure you can compare high end phones - but what can Apple offer for that price?"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,How is price not a category in this!?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"First off, you didn't even mention sideloading apps. That feature alone pushes the Apps category over to android. Don't like the YouTube app? There's countless variations, including some that unlock most of the premium features, for free on the internet to download the .apk file and install, completely bypassing the Google Play store and the Samsung Galaxy store. Then there's the emulators that are still on the Google Play store. Apple never lets emulators on their store for very long, if they can slip past their approval process. You can't tell me Apple wins Apps when they restrict what you can do with the hardware you bought so tightly.

Also, Samsung's ecosystem has the unique functionality of crossing over to play nicely with Google's ecosystem and Microsoft's ecosystem. The combination of those three ecosystems that all work together, as well as the variety an choice they provide, beats Apple's hands down. Don't forget about all of Google's smart home devices and features. If a smart home device can't pair with Google Home, it's dead in the water.

As for updates/support, sure, Apple has great customer service, but they'd rather sell you a new phone than fix your existing one. If we consider repairability, Apple has a long way to go. These vary widely on Android depending which company you look at. On one hand, the fair phone is a prime example of repairability being the first priority, and on the other, Samsung and Google support their old phones for way longer than I've ever had the same phone for, so in the end, there's nothing special about receiving updates for a long time. A lot of companies do that. This category should've at least been a tie, if not an android win because of the repairability of some brands.

Those 3 corrections make the winner Android 5.5 to 1.5. The only thing Apple has going for it is ease of use, but even that is iffy. To me, who has only owned Windows and Android devices, Apple devices are WAY harder for me to use. I would need a long time to acclimate to all the strange little differences in daily tasks. For someone who's never seen a smart phone before, yes, Apple is more beginner friendly, but for anyone with an ounce of tech savvy, they're both super easy to use. Apple just also has a low ceiling, meaning once you've got the basics, there's nothing deeper to dive into for more unique use cases. 

In the end, this video just reminded me why I will never buy an iPhone. I was getting tempted by the 15, but the only good thing about iPhones is the dumbed down user experience, which is a bad thing, to me. In the end, pitting one company with their own standard against an army of companies building on a shared standard is just no contest. If you limit Android to just Samsung or just Google, maybe you'd have a close fight, but if you're talking about all of Android, there's just too much variety to compare to one company, even if that company is as big as Apple. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I disagree that iPhone doesn't have bloatware I mean all the apps like apple health, apple podcast or the news app all few examples of apps that many people might not even install but they are still pre installed yes we can uninstall them but same can be done on Android the apps are made by apple doesn't mean they are bloatware I mean Samsung is many times criticized by reviewers for putting their own apps in the phone pre installed that are not useful for everyone then why are apple apps that are not useful to all not considered bloatware"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The ecosystem factor is not as strong outside the US; however, the main reason I won't switch is that I'm too lazy.

It's better to invest your time in other activities rather than learning new OS tricks."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The Navigation of Apple Apps are different on a per-app basis, meaning for example that you have to swipe down on the iPhone YouTube app to close the video, on other apps you then again swipe left or right to close something or go back again, this is simply very inefficient, makes my workflow very slow in comparison to Android devices, where going back is very consistent across apps ... The only real comparison basis you have is: ""Which devices get's the Job done faster in terms of the amount of gestures you have to do"", Android is the clear Winner here ... And besides, IOS is such a closed Black box, I would never buy this crap ever again. OpenSource is the future, makes the world a saver place and should be used by anyone... Android also started as the ""Android open source project"", later on, google started to put their trash into the OS ... But if you want a vanilla OS, it's still all there and wants to get installed on your devices as a custom ROM :D"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The real difference is price. Iphone is a trophy phone with a price justified by the logo. Android is just a different software system that is applicable for multiple phone manufacturers. Multiple phonemanufacturers allow a wider spectrum of options. I see WAAAYYY to many people buy the Iphone and act like it didn't blast a hole through their wallet. Specially young and broke uni-students. 

I also think we have reached a stage were phones are nitpicking in quality difference. The nitpicking feels over the top and to quote a wise man. ""If I can watch movies and Porn on it, it's NASA shit."""

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Personally i disagree with the apps category because of the one simple fact that not only are there more apps but you can litteraly download anything and the ecosystem category because of the fact that the ecosystem of one company that is apple is the best singular ecosystem compared to the ecosystems of every smartphone brand is way better when you have something that can connect with anything

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Switched to Android in 2017 when Apple came out with Iphone X over $1200. The Galaxy 7 was like $600 bucks with 1TB more space and way more features. I LOVE Google workspaces, docs, drive, gmail, phone. Google music app was/is WAY BETTER streaming platform. Never looked back and always had a better overall phone for less money and more control. LOVE ANDROID and yes I have a Macbook Pro :)"

Still have shit texting with iphones and any other phone. Maybe one day they will actually get better but texting is such a basic feature that still isn't being done right. It's 2024. Wtf"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,watch the video if u want but apple won bc hes in the US and popularityother than that android shoudlve won
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The biggest reason and advantage for me is the Apple ecosystem, how the devices flawlessly interact with each other. I probably will never know the joy of being able to customise your wallpaper and all the other things that Android offers, I'm convinced Android is equally an amazing OS,  I just can't see myself missing out of the flexibility of iOS and how it integrates with every app and device that I use.  I'm sure Android users equally have solid reasons for sticking with Android."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,But most android apps are free compared to iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I decided to try an S7 once 

Android it’s clearly such a badly optimised and written operating system. 

Error codes to do with Apk or something reminded me of of the windows blue screen of death ..

Audio randomly not working
Sorry but the share sheet that suggests people and apps on iOS was like either awful or non existent 

For a system that is designed to have multiple interfaces yet wasn’t designed in a compartmented way such as system then interface on top. So had to wait for security updates. Just shows how badly thought out Android is. 

not to mention its bloated system preferences. It felt like I was on a sort of nuts and bolts operating system not a professional consumer product with finish and everything working like text font sizes clashing with dialog boxes and translation that didn’t work properly I mean you wouldn’t get away with it with any other consumer product except an OS like Android 

Never again"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"If you were to do Apple vs Samsung with this exact same list, would you still give it to Apple? I think ""Ease of Use"" would still be Apple but the rest would become ties most of the time, right?"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I hate iphones. They embody everything wrong with corporate greed. You spent a fortune on it, but it wants all your money and data, forces you to put your bank details in it and it's a thief magnet. You need to use the health app to set the alarm. WHY?! I use the alarm as a reminder, not just for waking up.Good hardware, extremely annoying software. Also I like customization. I don't like Android neither but i can adapt it to my needs. It doesn't have the level of security & control I'm used to (Control over cookies ect). So Android gets 0 points and iphone gets -5. I just wish the pine phone worked."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I used to be a Apple guy, but then Android took off and i was tired of my iphone screen breaking and all the locked options and settings iphone doesn't even have or has locked it behind their IOS, i felt like i was getting robbed by Apple.

Updated Android apps have continued working well. I'm able to take my phone to a repair shop and replace a charging port, or a headphone port, or the battery, and they'll almost all have parts already on-hand and will have be back up and running in under an hour.
I daily drove an iPhone 4 back in the day. Ultimately, the ecosystem annoyed me endlessly and ease of use for my use was not good.
I'm still happy with the options available for the Android platform when making my choice of next phone.
That said, Apple has made it harder to ignore their updated devices. Even if only because, as a developer, I can't deploy to the platform without a device. The walled garden may bother me more than anything for that reason."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Apple is better you can track your phone if it’s lost and it’s smoother plus it get more updates

And ease of use i dont see the iphone as the winner either you have to use gestures or swiping android lets you choose that or have a simple 3 or 2 or 4 button menu at the bottom ease of use doesnt mean oh ive used iphones my whole life so i know everything cause they never change anything or innovate 

Ease of use is when ive never seen this phone in my life i can pick it up and instinctively know how to navigate/use it with ease...

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The ease of use categorie has to go to android. Just because of iTunes...
I had a iPhone for over a year now after always using android phones. I could never load all my music to the iphone, so I gave up. First, you have to tag all your 30k songs individually. And than, when I copied everything on the iPhone, so many songs where still missing. Why? Because Apple does not know this songs and they are not available on apple music. Also music got deleated apple did not like. WTF?!?? Who do they think they are to delete my things because they don't want me to have ot? So stupid. 
And no LDAC Codec aswell.
Hello Xperia 1V

And in terms of apps, I still had to charge my android phone every day when I used the iPhone over a year. Because there are many apps I don't got in the appstore. Mostly my language learning stuff was not available. Dealbreaker nr. 1000

(BTW, .arques, you rated the camera of the Xperia wrong, because you are not a photographer and it seems that you don't know how to use it right. :)
In the right hands, it destroys other phones cameras for sure..."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use goes to ihone????how????you tried connecting iphone with pc or even tried to share anything with iphone even with another iphone????aps goes to iphone????android can install anything....there is only 1 that iphone has an edge over android n thats security........and maybe cameras
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Ease of use would not go to apple when all they do is make products with design flaws and literal anti repair measures so you have to spend more money on a new phone or laptop. That is not easy that is a headhache

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I'll have to disagree with the ease of use and your basis of that. Except for this all is good with your presentation.  👍
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Well, you are obviously an iOS user and did not really understand Android well enough. Is it easy of use when every app has another way to go a step back, like on iOS, and you can not even mount it as a volume and use it on the desktop? Android is way more consistent, there are always the same basic buttons on the bottom present. And you can easily drag and drop any file into the mounted volume. So that point is clearly also gonna go to Android. The Ecosystem of Android is open and includes many brands, with their gadgets and services. That of Apple is a limited closed system to their own products and not very adaptable. So this point also goes clearly to Android."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"And then divide this ""4 vs 3"" score with price. 1000$ ios vs 400$ android. SO it will be actually 4 vs 7.
Wtf where is the price category?"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,You’re payed by apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The score is 2-5. Android has a much bigger variety of apps and functionalities through them. And the ecosystem...you can literally command google assistant through your smartwatch to flush the toilet

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I have to argue against your decision on the app criteria.

Forget updates, there are apps and features that you can find in one system and not the other. The difference? If you can't find something on the android, give it some time and you'll get it. If you can't find it on IOS, good luck.
The reason is simple, the IOS store is extremely pricey for a small time dev. Basically, if you don't plan to add commercials or have people pay for the app, it's not happening on IOS.

I have a friend who really likes this board game (a very popular on named Dice Throne), and the game had a campaign mode that was really missing an up to log or update your set of cards for the next meeting, so he built an app, uploaded it to the play-store, and paid the tiny fee. When people started asking about an IOS version, he told them he would give the source code to anyone willing to pay to put it on the IOS store. It's been a couple of years and he couldn't find anyone."

As good as Spotify is, when it comes to clarity and overall sound quality, Apple smokes anything in the android market. I'm a truck driver. I carry an S23 ultra for the simple reason that android works better with the things i require of my device. And if Im honest i feel my Samsung is a better balanced device. It doesnt shine as brightly as an Apple device in some areas, but it does more things with better consistency than Apple. And the reliability factor with Samsung, ie that the device is going to do what you need it to do when you need it is better with Samsung.......but when i get ready to seriously listen to tunes, ny earbuds are plugged into my ipad!"

I switched from Apple to Android for 3 weeks and the reason I didn’t like it - not the camera notch, USB-C/thunderbolt, customization, background colors or number of Apps - I wanted a decent built in music app and Android didn’t have a decent one and no, I don’t want Youtube music."

Until sept 2023 I have used android phones ( samsung, xiaomi and oneplust 6T best phone ever). For me IOS it's almost the same as android, personal thought. As per ease of use for me an iphone (IOS) doesn't seem to be easier to use as an android phone. It's the same from my point of view. As ecosystem: yes iphone-macbook-ipad yes it's better but you should take in consideration also the cost. How much cost is for an iphone + macbook + ipad? And how much an android phone  + a windows laptop and tablet.....nowadays everything is vs cost."

The freedom, the ease in sharing things across different devices, the usability (i use old devices, as apple's old devices are almost unusable due to the old ios version bot being able to download many apps) using an old android tablet the same age as the ipad still enables me to install most apps, or at least using an older version of the apk. Also, we have old android tablets that are equipped with the amoled screen, not the old ipads. And im in love with amoled despite my having to take a good care of it in order not to cause burn in.

And I can't use my iOS phone - so it locks me into also buying a mac if I wanted to. I would call this the developer category - yes, iOS apps are easier to update once created due to the devices, but creating an app on android is far more entry friendly as a developer.

This was a category I weigh highly as well, but probably doesn't matter to most users since they aren't developing apps as a hobby/work."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I dont care what anyone says, the ease of use is butt cheeks on Iphone imo. My wife wont switch off Iphone because she doesnt know if she will lose her pictures.(im not kidding)

I use Galaxy and I can never seem to figure out how to do what she needs. The settings are ridiculous. Its a list of like 100 damn settings with seemingly no rhyme or reason to placement. There is no designated back or home button, which makes no sense to not have.

On Samsung, when you upgrade your phone, the transfer is seemless. On Iphone, I nor Cricket could figure out how to transfer her pictures. I keep getting an error saying it failed to prepare the transfer. I looked it up and it is a known problem. I tried all of the fixes and none have worked so far. 

When I send videos to her through a message, for some reason her Iphone compresses my videos to where it is like 240p. But if an Iphone sends one to her, its fine...

When I scroll through her pictures, I can never seem to grab the vertical slider. It works like 8% of the time and she cant do it either. Thats on her old and new phone, so it cant be the screen.

I could say more but id be here for a week. I cannot stand Iphones. I recognize that there are some cool things like the autoecosystem but thats literally it for me."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The thing to remember about Apple, though, is its extreme anti-consumer attitude. They've been pulling dirty tricks for a very long time, and many people end up buying a new device for no better reason than Apple demands it. Screw Apple; the last Apple device I was willing to buy was the iPod (original 80GB model). Mine still works, but has been supplanted by a large SD card in my Galaxy S 9+, which will soon be replaced with a larger one. The nasty little tricks they pull, like the five-lobed screw-heads, can be gotten around, but it isn't worth the struggle or expense to repair a lot of Apple products.

As a dev who's been under to hood on both platforms, it needs to be stated how HORRIBLE Android has been for peoples privacy. And it's made even worse by the additional privacy violations perpetrated by the majors like Samsung. 

Go dig into the stack. Why is the (for example) Samsung photo gallery constantly talking to Samsung?  Is that OK with everyone?  

Why does almost every major process within the Android stack talk to the cloud???  

The amount and depth of the tracking and analytics being run on Android users is INSANE.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"This really misses quite a lot of things. I think this is more accurately iOS vs Android than iPhone vs Android. 
If we actually compare iPhone to Android then you have to take into consideration hardware options. On the iPhone side there is a limited selection but they are available basically anywhere in the world. On Android there is a vast, vast catalogue, sometime too overwhelming even, at a very diverse range of prices. And many of these are not available in many regions. 
Overall, regardless of if iOS is better than Android (which I don't think it is but lets just say for argument), my choice has always been Android just because of the vast quantity of options that fit my needs. 
That also comes with the drawback that there is no guarantee that two to three years from now the company that made the phone I like and have today will make a followup whereas we can say for certain there will always be an iPhone (well, almost certain, and for the near future)"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,people paying $1000 + for a phone is insanity..yet
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Good, balanced video. I'm android (live in Germany) and I really don't want an iPhone as I like the phones I've had and I really have a personal bias against Apple."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I was a loyal android user but I bought Iphone 15 a while ago and it’s the best experience I’ve had with a phone until now!
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,You left out the green bubble shaming category.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The real winner? Depends on the game being played here. The technocracy wins, the oligarchy wins.
The citizens lose. The last thing anyone needs is a better phone stealing all their privacy, life, culture, friendships, TIME, and critical thinking skills."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"i'm surprised that no one mentioned Face ID. I always have trouble with fingerprint sensors on Android and Apple devices. Face Unlock on my Huwei Mate 20 Pro unfortunately only works for unlocking the phone regardless that this is a true 3D face camera. But the iPhone on the other hand unlocks everything by face: the device, the App Store, several banking apps, password managers, you name it."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Apple does have ease of use. In which I like. Android allows you to post 4 to 5 minutes FB story videos in one clip without it splitting. Whereas Apple won’t. Also Android is much cheaper. You can get a bigger screen phone with Android and pay lesser money. Apple text messaging and FaceTime is better. Apple has also has better apps. Apple phones works better for business purposes. The winner for me is BOTH!! I have to have Android because I post music videos onto my FB story that last 3 to 5 minutes. Apple phone won’t let me do that. I use both phones. I use them both equally. But for me, if I had to pick one. It would probably be Android. Because it’s cheaper. You get a big screen phone for a fraction of the price. And it’s more flexible."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"APS category can NEVER, like never-ever go to apple. Here are just a few reasons:
- There are millions of hardware manufacturers, all over the world that want to their devices to be controlled wirelessly via apps (dishwashers, heaters, coolers, speakers, lights, medical equipment, scooters, garage doors,... and many many more). You can publish your app a zillion times easier and cheaper and faster in ""google play"" than in ""app store"". Whereas Apple is hugely limited on this part. Only expensive and well-known brands even take the effort to develop apps for Apple. 
- You can buy a NEW decent performing android phone for 150 - 200 USD and use all the google play but you can never buy an apple phone for less than 400 USD so the number of installations is significantly less. 

ECOSYSTEM !
connecting literally ANY and EVERY android capable device to an android phone is much easier, performs better, is faster than to an apple device. and only recently did apple make their devices accessible to android devices. Lets not again talk about the prices. EVERY and ANY android based device/accessory that matches the apple device/accessory price, performs better on both android and apple devices 

Just an opinion."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,seems like an absolutely massive category is missing. one that absolutely smashes the other categories into irrelevancy - possible value for money. i'm not made of money.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i really like to see if this video updated with latest iPhone with type c.. the features is now comparable with android phone..  :) just my two cents

1. Ecosystem- Apple
Done."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The IPhone is horrendous. If your screen cracks your phone is basically going to go to shit. Has happened to me twice already. My screen cracked ( not even bad) then my service was unavailable after 2 weeks) then WIFI was unavailable. After my phone is paid off going to go to android lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,You should consider playing some like music in the back round so it's not just you talking bc tbh love your vids but it's a little monotone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I need a must have feature:-
Call recorder.
Why iPhone lacks it free ? Or why not  inbuilt??"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,But one thing you didn't mention is that a LOT of iPhone features were 'borrowed' from Cydia back in the day & are still used today.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why would you pay thousands of dollars for a phone that has everything that the competitor has and is 10 times better.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Easy of use should be given to android, considering the ease of file transfer to any device, any format. IOs ease of use is confined to the apple environment mostly, whereas android is easy to use regardless of the  system at the recieving end.
Thats the fundamental when it comes to ease of use"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"What if all android phones/companies merge together with all their strengths & it just comes down to literally Android vs Apple, like say Pixel vs iPhone.

I think that'll be some insane competition... I'd definitely be team Android"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I'm glad I made the switch to Google Pixel, I love it"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Great comparison, very insightful."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"You talked alot about the Apple ecosystem and the Samsung ecosystem, but nothing on the Google ecosystem? Pixel phone, Pixel tablet, Chromecast notebook, Pixel watch, Pixel buds, Google Home, Google drive, etc. Apple placing high walls in their ecosystem is good if you're already locked in, but if you value freedom and customizability over blue bubbles then Google's ecosystem is heads and shoulders better."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Nah ease of use do not goes to iphone because you need tutorials for even unlocking the phone using the phone for the first time
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"huawei made best android phone, not samsung, google 😅"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I have an iPhone 13 and when I downloaded iOS17 it totally messed up my data. If I’m not on WiFi, it’s 50/50 if I am able to use the internet regardless of how many bars I have. It’s an endless cycle of updating software too much, too fast just to trap us into buying the latest and greatest phone."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Your categories did not include two of my most important considerations when buying a phone.  Security and privacy.  The last few phones have all been iPhones because I think they are more secure and privacy is better with Apple.  I used to buy Androids but switched when my kids and all their friends had Apples.  And after that it just seemed the iPhone was more secure and I have stuck with them for that reason.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Yeh I kind of outgrew the customisation thing back in Windows XP. 

Like, sure it’s fun, but you get to a point where nothing is Better than a clean, stock skin.
Now, if this was available across a ‘range of themes’ or something, I’d probably switch to Android 
But the other thing holding me back is, iOS just works for me 
It’s easy, simple, clean, I’ve not had to worry about security. (Yes, I know, I know, this effects all platforms)

The only phone that interests me from Android is the Nothing Phone,
Especially when you hear the creator talk about ‘receiving the same amount of information’ whilst looking less at the screen"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Trying to shop for a new phone is driving me absolutely bonkers. My current phone is 8 (EIGHT!) years old. I am not sure what features are most important to me 😂
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I will  take android as the winner bro
Andoid is more durable and comfortable to use than the ios"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Pour moi l'éco système c'est vraiment une question de point de vue. Peu de monde travaille sous mac OS et donc connecter un iphone à windows est une vraie galère. Il est facile de partager un album photo Google mais impossible de partager un album apple sur autre chose que icloud. WhatsApp n'existe toujours pas sur iPad...
C'est assez étonnant ce que je vais dire car j'aime les produits Apple et en particulier macOS. Mais pour moi l'iPhone est devenu le moins bon produit d'Apple. Je regrette uniquement l'App store où la qualité des applications est globalement meilleure. Sachant que quelqu'un qui veut un téléphone à la philosophie iphone sous Android prend un pixel."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"well some can very. for me, excitement depends on how it is, not its form. folding phones - ive heard those can break, gaming phones - the iphone 15 pro technically achieves that so im giving excitement to iphone"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The winner is not the phone, but the friends we made along the way."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"get over it, none buys android phones if they have plenty of cash. Android is for broke people who don't have anything to secure so they don't need security. 
Yes, come at me with all you have babe! Here I am 🤪"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"It's our money and we can buy any phone, that's not an issue. We watched the video to decide the software platform."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The Apple AirTags is a massive feature. Using all IPhones that are around to find an item is incredible useful. (Yes before switching from Android I tried Tile)😅
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Also musician apps are more on IPhone some are not existent on Android.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I don't use any Apple product not because they are not good or even top of the line! I don't use them because I feel like I have to get permission from a dead man to use it the way I want to use it.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,You did a good job
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iPhone of course 👌
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"bro choose not to war and i, we, everyone is happy. This really differs from person to person. You cant put your personal opinion  for all the people around the world, cause everyone has different taste, different priority, different way of use. 
Like I'm not a fan of camera or vlogging. I kinda person who checks all the notification from lockscreen and has about 0 patient to rest my phone a whole 1.5hr only for charging. So, for me I prefer andriond over iPhone."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I tried iPhone twice. Got the X, and ive had the 14 Pro MAX. Both phones I sold in 7 or less months after getting them. Hated the X. And 4 iPhone generations later, it was still embarassingly similar to the same experience."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I like how Apple actually listened and added USB C and a 5x telephoto lens to the iPhone 15. Hopefully fast charging is next in the 16 series
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"As a music nut and audio geek...There is no question.  I have an SD card full of all my music as WAV or FLAC files that I can just move to my new phone when I get one (No SD card slot on iPhone because Apple wants to control the storage so they can charge us for it). What about connecting to headphones or to a home audio system with a headphone jack to stream content from apps aforementioned SD card... iPhone's don't have that... okay, it's getting pretty hard to find Android phones with 3.5 mm jacks now too, but at least the APTX and LDAC codex are hard to distinguish from wired connections, but Apple only does AAC which is very distinguishable from a wired connection if you are in a quiet room listening to a good system or headphones. The lack availability of expandable storage and a headphone jack, or at least the better Bluetooth Codex are an absolute deal breaker and the reason why i don't even consider an iPhone when shooing for  a new phone."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Well discussed. Competition benefits us all.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,After having a couple Android phones I will never have any again. iPhones are so much easier and integrate in a system better.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The problem with android software updates are the US carriers. The android manufactures obviously get paid to allow carriers like tmobile to have the freedom to choose what phones get updated and what phones don't. There have been countless times that multiple LG phones i've owned where an android update was passed to tmobile but tmobile sat on it for months and by the time tmobile got around to pushing the update a new version of android is right around the corner keeping the phone always one step behind. T-Mobile gets paid big money to put apps like McAfee on your device.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I'm an Apple and Android fan, I've got Iphone 15 pro max, Pixel 7 pro and S23 ultra, they all got something I love. I must say, i use the Iphone for when I'm out and about everyday use, and the S23 for when i use Xreal2 VR glasses because of DEX, and the pixel 7 pro for indoor photos and i use it in bed, when i put the iphone to charge. Love the UI in both IOS and Pixel OS, not so much ONE UI as it hasnt got a very pretty UI even though it has a lot more features."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"No back button. STUPID AF APPLE. Not being able to transfer your photos and data to a PC when you have an Iphone, criminal. I currently have an iphone. So there you have it."

I have a galaxy note 10 plus a 2019 flagship from Samsung and a friend of mine have the new iPhone 15.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I had an Android for 5 years but then switched to an iPhone because I wanted blue text for college. Can't say I can go back to Android now. I have become an Apple sheep.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Im tired of these videos. Die-hard Iphone/MAC user who loves the feeling of superiority apple products give him, reviewing another android phone/version he will never set his tiresome iphone down for. Lets face it, if you didn't have android phones, what would you talk about? The titanium band on the latest iphone? Its comical: my friend has a MAC, and shes so proud of it."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Sure I've had apps crash on iPhone but they are way more reliable and stable than android, I stop buying android once Meizu started removing their headphone jack and memory card slot"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I can easily add 1TB of memory to my Android. Is that possible on iPhone?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Over I prefer Android but I too use both. Daily. There is many things each does that I like more on one or the other.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"For me anyway, it's all about the car experience and, sadly, Android appears to have forgotten about it while Apple is about to release a potentially game changing new version of Carplay.  It's the only reason I use an iPhone but it's a huge factor, so I'm surprised you didn't discuss it."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,7:50 just because Apple stores are everywhere doesn't mean that they have better customer service it just means they have a lot of stores. When I went to an Apple Store about an issue with the software and the phone itself they try to sell me a brand new phone my guy that is not good customer service that's just a salesman. I permanently switch to Google they have a much better experience.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I don't buy Apple as a matter of principle.
The last time I bought Apple products were 2 Newtons, which are now paper-weights.

BTW, I thought you were into Apple products, Marques.
That was why I stopped viewing your YTs, until today."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I think the ease of use thing is kind of overstated. I find actually finding things in IOS to be nightmarish. because of apples minimalist design many options and buttons just dont tell you how to interact with them or what they do. The example of you pulling down the bar from the top is perfect, in android most of those options are actually labelled. I think for someone who has never touched either they are probably equivalently easy to use.

In terms of support, I think its important to note that for power users an android phone will be usable for far longer. When apples planned obsolescence starts to kick in there isnt very much you can do about it, but with android you can switch over to a still supported lighter version of android which runs fine on your phone and doesnt intentionally throttle it."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Its like shopping, before buying something determine if its a WANT or a NEED? Then say to yourself, can this phone meet all the NEEDS in my checkbox? Can it do everything that I need for my everyday life? There are some things Apple does better than Android, and some things Android does better than Apple. After that, ask yourself does your personal privacy and security matter to you? Because each of these companies have very different business models on how they use your personal data. So do your research peoples. Then after that focus on the WANTS."

On the other hand, Android is for more experienced and demanding users in terms of options and customization.

There is no need to fight, you just have to know that both systems are for different people."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The biggest issue with Iphones I have is the stupid price. Than IOS updates designed to drain older Iphone.  But because of point 1 - I am forced to upgrade 4-5 years because battery just start to die less than 12 hours.  This sounds silly but outside US Iphones cost $2000. In saying that honestly user experience and Ecosystem of Apple blows Andriod out of water, and funny thing is I am spec geek when it comes to PC.  But for phone I just want simplicity and fluidity."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"You're absolutely 110% wrong.  And its not just because I'm team android.  Apple absolutely has better eou, and updates/support.  However you absolutely wrong about apps and ecosystem.  

I'll explain why.  As acknowledged android has twice as many apps.  Now where we disagree is quality.  You can always find an equal to or better app on the play store simply by using YouTube reviewers.  I challenge you to find a single app for a flag ship android not a potato thats lacking.  More importantly android has open source development for things you can't talk about without losing your funding.  Such as pirating apps which let's be realistic the number 1 reason people use android.  From downloading torrs for all sorts of software including running AAA consoles on devices such as Asus, red magic, black shark, to streaming Netflix and Hulu without paying a premium.  Not to mention more tools for developers & powe users.

The eco system again is matched alone by say pixels.  But android has the advantage of 3rd party devices for headphones and smart watches that have more features than stock pixel and iOS.  You just have to actually do your own research because there are ofc lemons.  Which again goes back to eou.  

Essentially if youre a basic user who doesn't use your phone other than basic calling, messaging, ""camera"" go with the iPhone.  Your dumbass can't fuck it up.  If you're an actual power user who uses a phone to it's full potential than android beats iOS 10 times out of 10.  Not to mention the hardware on the global markets.

We're talking 20gb ram 165hz built in cooling fans, bumper triggers, duel os software.  Nothing on the US market even touches it.  Let alone the lowly iPhone."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,but you are comparing one brand with so many others?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I agree with all your picks except for ease of use. This is sooo subjective. As someone who has never owned an iPhone I sometimes struggle to use my sister's phone. Apple has learning curve (like not having a universal back button) that might not be visible to life time apple users and vise versa with android. I think the phone you have been using the longest will be the easiest phone to use for you.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I was an early iOS user until the iPhone 7, then switched back with the iPhone 15. It's not that people don't want to switch; it's that they can't. Transferring photos is a hassle, native iOS apps are glitchy, and the lack of a universal back button, with each app having its own, is frustrating. The phone feels sluggish due to animation latency. It's disappointing to see iOS, once a leader, now lagging behind."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Love your videos. Just wanted to add that iOS doesn’t have scheduled texting. I’m switching to android just for that option.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,That’s great great video but I think you’re missing a category called longevity. I used to use android to two years. I would have to buy a new one. Then I switched to the iPhone 12 and I’m still using it and plan to continue doing so.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Ease of use better on iOS? Imagine having to open system setting just to access specific app's setting. Imagine having to save photos as files first just to send photos as document without losing any quality. Imagine you can't see any contact photos in call logs. It takes more steps to put cursor inside the word while typing. Imagine having to open system setting to change specific volumes. Opening hotspot is full of hassles.

Copy and paste, merging contacts from other devices, navigating chrome versus safari (even chome on iPhone isn't very good), being able to swipe on either side of the phone to go back, the notification tray, and the keyboard are all better on android.

And I've recently switched over to iphone while still also using an android device because my parents have a shared custody and my dad doesn't let me bring my phone (iphone) from my moms so I have an android at his house whih is the s23. And I've found a lot of times people arent very willing to give out numbers or anything especially if you have an android mainly because it feels uneccasary, i say this because iphone has gamepigeon, facetime, other stuff like that while like i said earlier android is locked away from these features."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"bro mixed eased of use and ecosystem and calls it a fair fight ? Dude, what were you on writing this vid ? You don't even talk about how closed Apple ecosystem is,while android is a lot more about freedom, sure it comes at a price of being maybe less accessible to some, which I can understand, but although I agree overall with your arguments I just think that it's very narrow-minded to think this way when it comes to ecosystem."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,To be honest I don't like iPhone because. One you have to go back to the main screen by pressing the circle button on the phone itself like he said android phones are way better more easier to navigate on I'd give. IOS a 0 they are just copying what samsung has aka meaning android

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,7:33 that’s a lie kinda o. You have like 10 apple apps that are installed on your phone and most you don’t use

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,What about price?

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"You forgot one option. SAMSUNG DEX. 
 IPhone is coming out with a descop version. 
But I can connect up to 5 Storage devices, that means I can connect up to 5 1 Tera to 2 terabyte SSD Drives,  transfer and back up videos and photos as well as documents to those drives. 
I can also connect to a scanner and printer  or an all in one. Though Printers are going on their way out. 
I can also connect using the DEX Doc to an either net port.  

With the various DEX Docks they range from cheap, to expensive. There is also rumors that in some cases, some docs could incorrperate additional ram in the future. 

The DEX Docks for those who are wondering what that is the best way to describe I it is... Just like when you up grade a PC, You have PC Slots, so the DEX Docks are like many PCI Slots, only USB 3.0 is much faster then a traditional PCI Slot. 

With the Desktop up and running, I have had people from various cooperations stating, where did I get that computer from, then I show them it is my phone.  

All in all you did a great job. But you didn't cover the features and abilities.  
Samsung DEX is deffintly improving, and when the devices like S 24 Ultra and s 25 Ultra comes out, this will make the phones  micro computers., it can be said that the S34 Ultra is a Micro computer in of itself.  I think, we're coming in to an era where the lines will be blurred.  Where OS of both Apple and iPhone will take on more computer features.  We could see in the future phones with multi ports as well as a new screen interface.  One that could resemble much more like a tablet or actual computer interface. 

I for see a time where our devices be it Apple or android (Samsung) will become micro computers capable of doing a lot. 
 From gaming, to office, to video editing and such. 

Also it appears Microsoft is really destroying windows.. We're also entering in to the 4rth industrial revolution. 
Who knows what we might get.  We might even get an OS that is totally AI."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"While I like the Samsung, I must admit, I like the safety of the iPhone.  For example, when I had a Samsung, I pushed an update on it and the thing shut down and never came back up.  That was after having it for a couple of years.  I’ve had my iPhoneX since it came out, and I don’t have that problem.  I know eventually I will have to get a new phone.  However, it is nice to not HAVE to buy a new phone the very next year.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,To be honest tho I do think that allot of the customisation on android is pointless

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I personally think build design and hardware should have in the list of factors as well. Also the price factor,  as not everyone can afford an Iphone easily. They charge a bit extra than most Android phones."

It's Android and it's not even close. I understand people who like apple because they are comfortable with it but in terms of the phone's overall abilities, it's so not close it's not even comparable. It's like 2K to NBA Live."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Apps was kinda wrong imo,I get that there are exclusive apple  apps but in general androids have everything you need and more with apks albeit less supported and secure."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how do I dislike this out of touch video more than 1 time
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"You should've placed price as to be considered, paying xxxx amount for the same shit you can get with xx, so yeah if you have any control over your pocket, you would pay double the price to have half an apple at the back of your phone."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Lot of the pro Apple arguments seem to be very US centric, I feel like it really depends on the region and how widespread is the support for various Android brands. In my country, I feel Apple support is crap compared to ... pretty much anything else. People also use Messenger and Whatsapp, so blue vs green messages is a non discussion. I could probably list more, but you get the idea."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nice

We purposefully inject code into your software updates to slow your device way the heck down to entice you to buy our newest as latest product that you already were using but we just renamed it to the next number aka iPhone 15

We have no customization what do ever, we force people to bully android users and not allow users to send or receive high quality android messages so we can brainwash the user into not talking to their android family members

We also had 2 major security breaches in the last 2 weeks, one with iMessage malware code and iMessage being accessed by android people (even though they weren’t doing it for evil intent, us apple people want to make it seem like it is because we don’t like when android users can have a fun time with our users)"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I don't think it's that personal at all. The way I look at it is if Google went under - no more Google- society is f**ked. If Apple went under, life continues😂😂. Think about it. From search, maps, YouTube.... Google is such a big part of daily life, whereas Apple is...meh, just Apple. There is no competition. The only reason to get an iPhone nowadays is just so you can say you have one😂😂😂. Like you said, they've both matured to a point where they mimick each other - with Android setting the pace. Apple holding on to their ecosystem just complicates things if you ask me; they should just start making android phones😂😂😂. They might as well; they already use all the apps😂."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Ease of use definitely goes to android. I had to Google how to navigate on an iphone. Whereas on android, there are just buttons on the bottom of the screen"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,You also can't unlock your phone with a thumbprint on the screen with iPhone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"There was a point in time where Apple was the clear and obvious winner, after all they spearheaded the smartphone revolution. I'd say somewhere around iPhone 5 I switched to the HTC one and have been on various Androids ever since. I like the customization it offers and the exciting innovations in form factor, it's nice to try new things. Switched from OnePlus back to Pixel to try out the new fold and it's awesome. iPhones are excellent phones, and very popular (does matter to some), with a coherent ecosystem that gets good support.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I think I have to disagree with the updates/support round going to iPhone.
Sure, the iPhone 10R gets official updates, but with Android you've got custom ROMs...
The Samsung Galaxy SII from 2011 just got Android 12 for example. That's 11 years of updates."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Apple phones cant capture big market like India:
1)Very basic - Apple phones lack complete language support. In whole of India of > 140 crore people, Apple phone only support Hindi display, other languages - major languages Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and other very big India languages are ignored. This is more than 15  years since languages became standard in Android. Biggest shame is a few years back a Telugu character caused the phone to hang. This is enough to for people not take Apple. The company is too arrogant to the market needs. Over 60% of the Indian market remains ignored due to this corporate arrogance. Must be similar in other countries which have multiple languages, the Apple phone will support some ""elite"" language and ignore the rest of the market.
2)Forced region restriction. Apple apps cannot be installed in the ""wrong"" country. Android APKs and playstore apps can be unofficially installed anywhere in the ""wrong"" country.
3)Paid apps for free - modified apps in the form of APK files can be installed in Android, this is impossible in Apple.
4)External storage eg. 1TB SD Card - Apple phone dont have it.
5)Bluetooth compatibility - Apple phones have some problems trying to transfer files to any device through Bluetooth.
6)Local news customization, dont even know if any bigshots in Apple know what this means. (You set the phone to your preferred language, over 100 languages natively supported, you get the entire OS, news, even ads customized to that setting).
7) Servicing replacement cost - cost of replacement of Apple display is many cases is more than a new Android phone.
8) Back button is not there in Iphone."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"For me, my perspective on Apple vs Android has changed over the past 18 months. I've had iPhones since I was 14 (for reference, I'm now 23) but I plan to make the switch when the S24 comes out. Up to this point, the Ecosystem has been my top priority by a wide margin. However, since I got out of college and started my career about a year ago, the ecosystem doesn't matter nearly as much to me anymore. Whenever I was in high school, and especially in college, having the seamless pairing of Airpods to my phone was a big deal. Now, I almost never wear my AirPods. I listen to music at home mostly and I use my Sony XM5 for that. Being able to use my phone in conjunction with my iPad and Macbook was part of my everyday life. Now? I don't use my iPad and my Mac stays plugged up to my monitor at home and is used as a desktop. I do love my Apple Watch but it's the least necessary accessory for me. I can see myself going back to a normal watch. Now, I don't use many apps apart from food, banking, twitter, youtube, and one of my coloring games lol. I'm not constantly texting friends anymore and I've never really used facetime much.

In conclusion, now that I've grown up, what kept me with Apple doesn't seem to matter to me anymore."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Hey there, great vid! 
I would disagree with the 'ease of use' cause switching from ios to Android and vice versa is a pain in the ass. So I think it depends on what U are used to. I have been using Android from the start and when I use an iPhone it's just not easy...  
I live in Serbia, and we are not dependent on Apple eco sys. Here the main reason why ppl buy an iPhone is the 'Cool Factor'. They are spending a lot of cache buying a powerful phone just for Viber, Snapchat, Instagram, and selfies... Those selfies are filtered with some filters and looks like it was taken with HTC from 2012. But... it's an 'iPhone' :D 
Here, the iPhone is a status symbol, nothing else...
Quick story:
Kids in school are often rejected from other kids if they are not using an iPhone. I remember a colleague from work saying 'I must buy an iPhone for my kid (6th grade), she's been rejected by her friends because of using an Android'. Instead of putting the kid in another school, she is thinking of buying an iPhone for the kid... Crazy world these days!

Also, Apple products are very expensive compared to Android devices, so for me and ppl from here, Android makes much more sense."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android is the clear winner

There is no one good phone right now in this world for me. What about battery, I never see a phone over 5 hours of my intense use never, ever. I can build the perfect one, but I don't have the budget and no one will build what I want. Even is possible. Idk nothing about Apple beside us very expensive, so I keep it there and get one Android I can much more customise. Even S23 ultra has many limits, I think for me is actually the best chiuse even limited from Samsung. They can do much more, but they don't want it."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"What about battery life, wouldn't Android be far more superior at the arguably most important aspect of a given phone? 

And as for the quality over quantity in regards to the play app store, wouldn't a huge quality not also be the exact quantity of having a larger array of games and other apps to choose from?

If so, then the winner would be Android."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I like both, primarily use iphone for the ease of use though.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The reality is that if you switch a top Andoid with an Iphone you will miss it, but if you do the opposite you won't. Many people just buy a bad android just to have a phone, then switch it with an iphone and then say ""wow, iphone is unbeatble"", but if you have a S23 ultra, you'll hate everything of Ios. The unic reason to buy an Iphone is that you have always been with Apple or if you are a video creator, because they have much troubles on basilar things: the volume doesn't split (no different choice for multimedia and ringtone), if you are seeing a video with the full screen you can't even watch what time is it, or a message, because if you open the menu ios will close your app. So I can say that in every case Android wins, just buy a top android for all/business or an Iphone if you are a content creator. Peace😅"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"How could you not include perhaps the most important comparison point: PRICE? Right from the earliest iPods, I looked past the hype and dug into the specifications to directly compare things like memory capacity and battery life to get a more accurate comparison of value for money. I have added Apple products to the mix several times when buying MP3 players and phones over the last two decades to see if it was worth buying one, and I have never found an Apple product that is even close to competitive on price. In my view, Apple has always sold ease of use at a premium. If a product is better, if it is worth more, I'm happy to pay more, but as mentioned in the video, ease of use usually comes at the expense of customization. I am a person who learns quickly, and I've always been comfortable with navigating the complexity of new tech. Whenever I get a new piece of technology, whatever it is, the first thing I do is dig into the settings to see what it is capable of and how I can customize it. I get frustrated when I want to tweak something and the option isn't available. I will take flexibility over ease of use any day of the week. In most cases, Knowing that about myself, I have found that I would pretty much always take an Android product over an Apple product at price parity, just for the flexible customization. When the Apple product is significantly more expensive, the decision is an easy one for me. My mind is always open, I'd be happy to someday find an Apple product that I felt was worth the price, but that hasn't happened yet."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Pretty interesting video. I think there is one factor that moves people to use an iPhone and it is STATUS, people pay way more for the phones and for being in the ecosystem because it makes you more (as a consumer) than others, period. In other words, apple sells and markets its brand really well."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Very well thought out and presented video. I am a iPhone user and I agree with you 100%.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I'd love to see a ""which is better"" video regarding security and privacy between Android and iOS.  Not only regarding how much access to our data 3rd party apps have, but how much Google and Apple themselves can scrape and sell.  I know privacy is a nonissue for a lot of people, (they just can't be bothered to care), but for those that do it's definitely a deciding factor."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I'd personally give ""best ecosystem"" to Android. As seamless as Apple's options are, because of Apple's tyrannical control over their own software and hardware, you basically have no freedom of choice. Want any accessories? Well, you have about a million different choices and then the SINGLE best, super expensive, Apple option, that can often even be gimped in some way (hello magic mouse)."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I think the big category missing here is price. Yes there are android phones that are more expensive than iPhones but there are many androids that are far cheaper, than the even the cheapest iPhone. 

To go one step further than that, look at price equivalent to features. I could get an iPhone with the features I want today, but it could cost me $500-$1,000 more.

These are huge factors for many people, which this video just ignores"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I personally prefer android as alot of android phones are cheaper and more efficient than iphone, plus alot of iphones use samsung chips so they wouldnt be what they are without android"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,It just sucks because I really really love apple way more than android but the customization is so unstoppable and i love how android is constantly evolving where apple is stagnant.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"After purchasing my Samsung Z Flip 4 phone last year, I encountered multiple screen display issues. Under the assumption that these were factory defects, I sent the phone to Samsung for repair, expecting it to be covered under warranty. However, to my dismay, Samsung initially denied the fact that it was a factory defect.
Furthermore, I was shocked to learn that Samsung requested a payment of $377.79 for the repair of a phone that I had recently purchased. Adding insult to injury, Samsung had the audacity to offer me the option to purchase a new phone while still holding onto my current phone and refusing to ship it back to me. Despite my clear indication that I was willing to fix the phone myself, they disregarded my request.
As a result of this disheartening experience, I have lost all trust in Samsung's products and services. I have made the decision to switch to Apple for my future phone needs."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The iPhone is the clear winner, simply based on a single factor. Reliability. Ive owned three iPhones, they all still work perfectly to this day (getting continual software updates helps, not happening on a droid) along with superior build quality. I had probably 10 or more droids, all mid level to high end, not one lasted more than 18 months. Your results may vary, but its a no brainer to me, for that reason alone. I used to love droid, wanted nothing to do with overpriced iphones....then the light came on...if they last 5 years instead of one, they are a better value."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I think he gave a fair assessment for the most part. He actually named what each phone type's strengths and weaknesses are, though anyone could contend with some of those things, including the categories he decided to make. Of course few viewers are going to agree 100%, and I think there are important distinctions that he didn't point out. He gave the winner of most categories to iPhones, but said he was an Android guy, and gave the reasons why. What more do you want? You know he doesn't want to alienate either side, because that whole side would likely stop watching his videos. So, he sure as hell isn't going to bash either side. And there is no reason to bash either side. Each side fits certain types of people better and is a good choice for certain people."

You never see someone complaining with a Samsung s23 ultra that its laggy and buggy... cmon ppl
As iPhone has only good stuff, there are a lot of Android phones that just don't work, you pay 200$ to get a not even low end phone, you get what you paid for.. then next year when it's slow you change to a phone ""worth"" 2000$ and you say android is sht...😅"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"the reason developers chose ios over android isn't because of what is harder or easier to program - it's about how much easier it is to drain peoples wallets on the ios. that's literally it, nothing else.  not sure where you got your i fos, but plenty devs even said that iOs is terrible to design for because you have to exactly use apples programs which are terrible to use and force devs to purchase it.

also you talked about the ecosystem and ONLY compared samsung to apple... the strength of android is that it has many more ecosystems. if you were objective you would give it to android"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"have been a Samsung user most of my life, and switched to iphone i can definitely say that Android are easier to use to understand and clearly straight forward. 
1. in androids they have a pause button when taking a video
2. customise alarm ringtones with your songs that you download ( iphone ringtone are harsh!)
3. individual setting volume setting for alarm, call,notifications and media.
the settings allow much more features.
4. transferring photos and videos from iphone to a laptop to empty up some space is a headache literally with androids it's quick and easy
5. people about face time and iMessage are probably like in US and Canada side because here in india these two features are literally the most useless elements( we use WhatsApp)
 i personally also think that if you are in Asia then iphones have to adapt with people rather than androids."

Apple scamming you by being more expensive for services such as YouTube music compared to android YouTube being cheaper

Apple and how they screw android people over with their friends since iPhone users will bash and kick android users out of anything since they’re a green bubble

Apple and how they release overpriced products that you can’t even customize or run roms/apks on since I have Mario galaxy 144 hz at my phone

Apple and how they break so easily especially iPhone 15

Apple and they’re evil business tactics by forcing you to go to their shop just to get a “battery replacement” but then that battery dies faster than older one in a few weeks"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I've always been a Samsung Android phone owner (Note series) and now I have the S23 Ultra.  Every time I think of trying the iPhone I remember how often I plug my S23 Ultra into my Windows computer and it acts like a flash drive which isn't the case with an iPhone.  Also I have thousands of my own songs.  I'm not sure how iPhone would handle the music that I already own.  Going to an iPhone just seems to limit me much more than my Samsung so I'll happily stay with Android.  Great information in this video.

But iOS is not as solid as it used to be, not everything ""just works"". The control center not being able to switch WiFi and Bluetooth off is annoying since day 1. AirDrop and CarPlay bug on a daily basis. And there was this thing where suddenly half my contacts were not able to iMessage me or vice versa, it only allowed SMS. On the other hand I like the reminder app for sharing lists with my family, I like iMessage (with Gamepigeon mini games :D) over the more popular WhatsApp here, I like the shared albums in the gallery. I'm sure I could make the switch again, but this iPhone is the longest lasting phone I ever had and I'm only 2 years in. I'm always scared of missing the one I'm leaving behind."

I'm just right now at the crossroads again for my next phone.
My problem is - I really prefer Android on the phone, but Apple Watch over the Android watches.
Sadly Apple watch doesn't work well with Android so..... a loss either way, I'm still undecided"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I'm not sure ""apps"" should go to Apple. Given one of the most used apps for communication there is - WhatsApp - is simply ""trash"" for IPhones. I say it in """" because it's of course still usable but with so many features either removed or made unlogical (however granted I'm not up to date with if if was made better in the last 2 years since I tried it on an iPhone but it just shows that Android is NOT marching behind iOs).
Or I remember my freind and I decided to play something together on our smartphones and we couldn't figure out why my freind couldn't find that one game in his store... turns out he had Apple Store ... so we had to swtich to a worse game that we both didn't really want to play that much instead...
And another 2 cents for the Ecosystem: Samsung and Apple are quite expensive brands to build an ecosystem on. Chinese brands like Xiaomi and Huawei are catching up really fast in that field and by the looks of it they are able to do it way cheaper. They still have a way to go but neither Apple nor Samsung ""care"" about the users finances and are not even trying to make their ecosystems available for us, ""mortals"", who have limited finances..."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"On updates, maybe apple has updates for a longer time but when the updates stop you get a useless brick.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"For me, when I think of Android versus IOS, it all comes down to freedom. I use an Android, not just because I like to customize my phone, but because I like being in control of MY phone and I require having MY choice on which devices to use, rather than BEING CONTROLLED by my phone, or the company that produces it. Apple is a control freak that uses cheap tactics to get and keep users, and I can't stand control freaks or people that walk the line when it comes to cheating."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The only category I really disagree with is the updates/support category. Apple has seen multiple class action lawsuits for intentionally destroying battery life with software updates to encourage people to buy new phones. That is some scummy shit, also as for apple stores being everywhere to give support, unless you have apple pay you are probably not getting your device fixed. Instead you'll probably end up needing to buy a new device, unless it is a computer, which honestly is terrible support. Also Apple is waging a war on right to repair which honestly falls under support, spare parts for android phones are easy to find and you don't need a custom screwdriver set to fix your phone."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I haven't owned an Apple device in well over a decade, but I pretty much ranked every category the same way you did. While I am personally very invested in the Android system, I do like a lot about what Apple does. Every couple years when I upgrade to a new phone, I consider switching to Apple, but I'm the end something new and different on an Android keeps me there. I've been on the Samsung ecosystem for a long time (specifically the Note series from the Note 5 on), but I just bought a Pixel 8 Pro. I really considered the iPhone, but to me the just look so dull and cookie cutter since they really only have one phone with different sizes. Android just offers so many different styles, looks, feels, and gimmicks. I like uniqueness too much to let all that go. I even change my launcher ever few weeks to keep my phone feeling new and fresh, which (as I understand it) you just can't do with Apple. I love the simplicity and efficiency with a lot of what Apple does, but I can't give up the ability to really make it my own and to keep changing it so it feels new and fresh for 2-3 years. I'm giving up my Note 20 Ultra after 3 years, but it still feels new since I can change it so often."

Personally, me using both android and apple, at least i was on android for a bit. I realized that in the long run.. they are the exact same phone, with different settings, different customization options, etc. Im personally locked into apple now, i have the apple watch, the ipad, macbook, airpods. Everything works seemsly and thats what I like about it, being able to text my friend through my laptop while in class, or even at work and not being obvious about it. iOS vs Android is.. once again another battle I hope we finish like we did with the console wars."

But if that phone does not get at least 4 years of guaranteed support and customer support is next to no nonexistent, I'm not buying your phone.

There are a few ""electronic stores"" where I live, but only Apple (out of the phone/computer companies) has a physical retail location anywhere near me and luckily in my city, so I can walk in and demo the products before I commit. And their customer support is the best I ever dealt with plus I know they'll deliver on updates.

If any Android phone manufacturer matched that, you may have my attention. But dealing with actual representatives and seeing the product in person before buying is a strong category for me."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,If Apple could get their gestures in order I'd switch. It's impossible to use an iPhone one handed with the back button in top left.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,This discussion can't be held by Americans because the apple ecosystem is inescapable. The bias is unreal. Anywhere else you'll find people use WhatsApp to contact each other and nobody has an apple to air drop them stuff. I can go on but I think the point is clear.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The one thing I can’t stand about android, is that you only get one to two years of system updates for your device.

While I can’t really complain about smartphones, because most people don’t use their phones for 5 years like me, it is unacceptable that android tablets get such short update support. I have a Galaxy pad which is flawed and aging because support ended a long long time ago.

I chose an iPhone this time for this reason. On the one hand it’s more powerful than I’ll ever need and will get system updates for a long time to come, but on the other hand the battery life is fairly horrific. I never had to charge my android smartphone so often when I didn’t use it much."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I'm a long-term Android user (Pixel specifically) and I'd switched to an iPhone 13 for about a year before switching back to Pixel. This is my take:
* iPhone certainly works well with its own ecosystem, but if you're not already invested in it, it's extremely painful to work with.
* My workplace uses SMS authentication which I have to use about twice a day to login. With a Pixel my messages are available from a web browser to just copy paste the OTP when I get it. With iPhone, I can't do that... Plus, most workplaces don't give you the option of using whatever OS or computer you want. Android messages can be accessed from literally any web browser.
* Many of my old CDs have been ripped into FLAC. To get them on Android, I connect it with a cable to my PC and copy-paste them over. On an iPhone that doesn't support FLAC by default, I gotta put them on some cloud account and then import them into some third-party app which is specifically designed to play FLAC files. Even then the integration is just janky.
* The most important features from my Pixel that I simply could not live without on an iPhone are call screening and voicemail transcription. I believe they've added the transcription thing now, but call screening is amazing when the caller is unknown and I just want the assistant to deal with them (more often than not it's spam).
* I'm using Sony WH1000-XM3 headphones, and those just sound better over LDAC when listening to FLAC encoded music. iPhone doesn't support LDAC. The sound quality difference isn't very significant, but it's certainly noticeable. I was hearing a difference for sure which is why I went digging into why it doesn't sound as good as my Pixel.
* The home screen on iPhones just puke all apps onto them. It's such a mess and there's no easy way to sort them. Android has a clear app drawer which sorts everything alphabetically and lets you put frequently used app shortcuts on the homescreen. This is significantly cleaner.
* iPhone does not show notification icons in the top bar. That annoyed me quite a bit. Also why can't music player controls just be swiped away? These are just minor annoyances but yeah, still annoyances...."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i just want peace if you like a phone then thats good but you dont need to start hating the others
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The more features it has, the less useful it will be. The phone has become a baggage that complicates people's lives. It's a disease really."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Ive had both.. and i definitely prefer my android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,But the galaxy a54 5g which I'm buying is getting 5 years of updates
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I noticed something he kinda pointed out and it’s that’s Apple gets updates longer and how iPhone XR or whatever is also geting iOS 17 but he didn’t fully explain that’s only software updates and that even older iPhones still get security updates meaning they are still safe so even tho the  phones is most likely slow and outdated you don’t really have to stress out about security

About apps, Android is a winner, because I can download any app besides a store which saves me money and gives me more options."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Fantastic review. Thank you so much. I'm an Android user; I am sending this review to my iPhone obsessed brother tonight. And you are right--it is an Eden of possibilities
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Is crazy that you didn't mention pricing/value.
Here's android clear winner.
Like u can get cheap android.
There are very wide range of prices.
With apple it's all ""premium"" devices, for VERY premium prices"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Ecosystem: Applee. Any day of the week. Android haven't even come close to it and will never get close to it.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"now i know why i was never pulled towards android. bid factor for me is ease of use and a super low factor is customisation even though i do like a good design, it just doesn't have to be unique, couldn't care less hahah ^^
all the other factors are either not relevant or not that relevant to me. one other thing that would be big for me is price, but since i got my iphones second hand and i'm not too big on the newest features and best quality in everything i'm happy with a cheap old iphone ^^"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Man I been watching this channel for years now and just realized I wasn’t subscribed until Marques just said to and I checked  lol. One of the best channels on YouTube.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I was sad to switch to the iPhone because I felt like I lost a lot of features from Android. I've had an iPhone for 2 years, and I am returning to Android. Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra for the W."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I’ve used android for so many years the problem with android it will freeze up and update and want to delete my apps . So I got tired of using my Google One Plus Nord N100
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,About the apps according to me Android should be the winner as Android gives you the flexibility. You can get many great open source softwares on Android. Also even for a very small work an app can do ios developers charge a lot whereas in Android these features are either available natively or you can get free apps.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,So what everyone failed to see was Marques knew Google was about to flip the script with updates....  Now with 7 years of support/updats that now puts Andriod at 4 and Apple at 3 lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I can't lie android really proved itself this time and many times before, with the revolutionary touchscreen pen, incredible camera zoom technology and let's not forget the new flexible displays, Like the awesome Samsung Z Flip and Z Fold👍"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Android any day for flexibility, functionaliy and productivity. Apple is just damn hype, just nice design and great hardware. OS is a joke."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,12:18 what is this phone?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Very good comparison of Apple and Android and I like how you presented the pros and cons of each, but the one thing that gets under my skin is how iPhones are made around fashion and style. If I only had a nickel for every time Apple said 'beautiful' and 'gorgeous' in a keynote."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Iphone is a next generation Nokia replacement for simple minds.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Ease of use to apple? Oh my god, this is so wrong for me. It's just a nightmare compared to android"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Hi marque i Hope this question its appropiate for you i want in 2010 what was your future phone prédiction really terme of screening or display ??? 😂🎉😂🎉😂🎉
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about safety?????? Where is this feature?? Or you going to tell me that they are on the same level????
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Even tho im an iphone suporter, absolutely yes, android is faster and smother than the real iphone"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I had an iphone 3 and 4. Then switched to Android. I stayed on android from probably 2011 until 2021. A solid 10 years, and I would switch phones often, I had them all, BLU/Samsung/Motorola/unihertz I had the flips, everything. I would change probably once every 6 months. I switched back to iphone in 2021 just to see. I am on my second iphone since. I have a solid perspective on what's better on both. Bottom line, imessage is the sole reason to stay on Apple......"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"iphone is ""ease of use""?! really?! lol"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"As someone who has used both over the years... From a purely user-experience perspective, Apple is so far ahead of Google. Especially with the Apple written apps.. iBooks, iMovie, Pages, Numbers, etc.. Compare them against their Google counterpart and there's no competition. Even the integration of Apple Watch is just too well executed. Android isn't bad, but Apple is just more polished. It's a Lexus vs a Toyota. Additionally, depending on who makes the Android phone, the experience will be different. Pixel vs Samsung. Samsung puts so much crap on the phone (i.e. shitty BIxby force bounded to a button which I think they finally made something you can disable)."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I would have got an Andriod if I didn't love my iPad and MacBook so much. I only care about ecosystem features on the iPhone at this point. Androids are great, but their ecosystem is still not as great (or as easy to use) as Apple's. I want tech to just work for me instead of having to dig into the settings and waste time trying our gimmicky features. The iPhone 15 Pro Max has a 5X zoom and USB-C but still no fast charging. I will still keep my iPhone 13 though. Still loved it and the green color."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Weak. Make a decision once in a while. Excite your viewers…
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I had Samsung Note for 5 years and worked fine. When it was time to retire it, I opted to try Iphone 13 and sad to say after 1 year and 8 months, my Iphone 13's battery became worse and started to lag with minimal use or the same level of usage as I had used my Samsung Note. In conclusion, bang for the buck Note (my most amazing phone ever), but for looks, handiness and great ecosystem with my other apple products, Apple wins the case. But morally, they should be able to create iphones that are worthy of their price not some high priced but china level of quality. Dude, that is day time robbery. Have some conscience."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"After twenty-two plus years on Apple and eleven years on iPhone, I switched in 2020 to a Samsung Note 20, also to Windows. After two weeks-ish on Samsung I wondered why I had not switched sooner. The Note 20 is amazing, still my daily driver, having many more features, both for business and personal, not even available on the iPhone. Here is one thing that bothers me about Apple especially iPhone, iMessage. Many folks will not respond to green bubbles. I knew of a person having a job interview, got the job, they texted the person asking them to come back for onboarding. They responded from an Android phone, green bubble, they rescinded the job offer. Reason, they did not like Android users. There was a man having a date with a lady, she saw his Android phone asked a few questions about it. He said she became cool to him. He questioned her change in attitude, her comment it I do not date Android users. What about grammar school, high school, college students, using Android phones being left out of groups, made fun of, looked down upon as if they did not have enough money for an iPhone, the list goes on. This iMessage is a bullying app used against Android users. There have been many articles in the news, on YouTube, on TV, demonstrating how iMessages is used to belittle folks for not having an iPhone. Yes, I have heard folks do it to others either to their face, or to friends ""I do not do Android users"" and the like. Too numerous to count Apple has been called out for their walled garden of iMessage and FaceTime and the bullying it has caused. During the Epic v Apple trial in Calif Apple admitted they are afraid to open iMessage fully to Android users for fear of losing their own users. Even though I am an Apple stockholder, I will never again purchase any Apple product. Purchase all the Apple products you want, as an Apple stockholder I will appreciate it as it will financially help me."

- Can install custom ROM (switch to more privacy focused OS e.g. Graphene or /e/ OS)
- Easy to fix and have cheap part on marketplace
- And... type-c

iPhone just released new phone, it got type-c, but it's hella expensive and hard to repair, so no."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Haven't had an iPhone since the 4s and when I have to use my gfs iPhone 13, I have no idea how to do basic features. The new gestures they added make me want to just turn the damn things off. I used to always agree apple had ease of use down, but since they took away the physical home button, I no longer agree. LG and Google have incredibly simple and intuitive operating systems."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I think it should have been a 3 - 3 - 1 draw. I'm a Pixel fanboy and agree with everything that he says here with the exception of the app landscape. I think that's a wash.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"POSSIBLY, The Main Reason for NOT getting an iPhone. It's Stupid Extra Large Camera Notch! Are they now The Only company who persists with this feature/ ABOMINATION?"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"as an iphone fanboy, I am offended, frustrated, insulted, violated, harassed, assaulted, angry, raped, hyperventilating and rage crying because other android companies have managed to be good in more than just a few categories. the iphone must not be surpassed in some categories. i really like the now slightly faster-charging, photography, screen resolution, better durability, more features, longer battery and i think even longer than the rog 7 ultimate which was said to be the longest, and also the 60 fps which throttles down to 40+ fps genshin impact gaming after 1-2 hours or so with the iphone which is the game i play the most during my days-off.

i hope android does those things i mentioned especially the gaming part because throttling is a pain. never tried the latest android flagships before but i'm sure iphone does literally everything better. i'm sure the s24 ultra, when it comes out, won't even be close to the iphone 15 pro max. i feel this is true, even my high school girl friends say so!

also, i feel like it's not true that the iphone is being overhyped. the apple world is full of honest people. i mean the apple company even excluded chargers to save the planet! some experts say it actually harms the planet more because ordering a charger online will consume another box and sometimes the box is even bigger for delivery, and also the fuel needed and other miscellaneous resources for logistics, but i personally believe in apple's integrity and concern for the planet, i can just strongly feel it."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Apps category focuses entirely on social/productivity apps and completely ignores the gaming half of what the apps category should encompass. 
Remember that the vast majority of gamers are mobile gamers, so ignoring that entire section is pretty bad. And with that in mind, Android wins hands down. 
It's not even close. I'm an iPhone user (originally bought it for battery life, but now I have an apple card so I'm kinda stuck until I can afford to have a second phone), and the swath of missing games in the app store is appalling. 
The biggest category of missing titles is RPGs, IDK why but the RPG category on iOS is basically empty. Apple has always been strongly anti-gamer, even now as they pretend to give a shit they release features that are expressly anti-gamer, so it's not surprising that a lot of games are missing but come on man...

As I was writing this I actually came up with 2 more things that push the apps category into Androids favor. 

First, ADS. Ads on iOS are FUCKING AWFUL. The lack of back button means the ads are entirely unskippable and on top of that they allow the ad developers to create ads THAT DON'T HAVE A CLOSE BUTTON. So not only can you not close the ad once it starts, you can't close the ad once it finishes either. You have to completely close the app and open it again. THAT'S FUCKING AWFUL.

Second, Apple's decisions regarding content control. Apple hates its users and it especially hates users that want to use the content that they own. Sideloading apps is intentionally made to be as difficult as possible. Not because they want you to use ""safe"" apps, but because they want you to use apps they can control and profit from. Plain and simple, they're greedy. Nowhere is this more clear than with their stance on emulators. They openly do not allow emulators on the app store even though they break no laws in any countries that matter (sorry North Korea, but you suck ass). 

So basically, Apps category should go to Android. While I agree that there is a small subsection of apps that are objectively better on iOS. 1, it's a very small subsection. 2, the apps aren't better enough to completely ignore every other subsection of apps that exist.

I'm not saying Marques is an Apple shill or anything. More like, he just didn't think about people that use phones differently than he does. Basically he's an elite culture snob out of touch with the common man, but that's kindof a given when you've been successful and had open access to so much tech for so long."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,We are..
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i highly disagree on the apps cause in africa some countries cant even access the youtube app on the appstore i mean you cant download it on the app store which is very crazy so the w has to go 2 the android.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what is the intro song playing in the beginning of the video?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I was considering getting back to android after using iPhone for 6 years. But then I realized I’m too far into the Apple ecosystem. I have AirPods, iPad Pro, Apple Watch. And going into android would make them unpractical. Guess I’m stuck here for a while lol"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I think Android should have won out on the ecosystem being how much more open it is.  Those Apple walls are a double-edge sword.  I definitely find it an issue with work which uses Windows PCs.  The android ecosystem just meshes well with anything and is much more flexible.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I'd like to say, on the basis of updates, When you say ""Samsung announced in 2018 that all devices in 2019 or later will get four years of security updates and some flagships will even get five"" For anyone thinking about buying an Iphone or an Android(correct me if I'm wrong) will probably be comparing the Latest or second latest Iphone to the Latest or second latest, Android and if it's Samsung you'll probably be thinking of the latest flagship, so to sum it all up, if your comparing the two then Samsung and Apple will be tied. And far above that Google announced 7 years, and though it's probably good to mention their bad reputation when it comes to these things.  So I would say if you, like a lot of people are considering a Samsung, they will probably be tied thus tying the score between Iphone and Android(I know kind of a bummer). And if your considering a google than Android actually beats Apple by a large margin making it win in the points(even though like Marques said, it's about your personal necessities in a phone). 
Feel free to give your take in the comments, but please keep it civil(unless I really messed up then I guess just lay it on me)"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"What about battery life, resistance/strength, charge time, and cost?"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,All new iPhones in 2023 can use usb type c charging so your facts homie before talking shit
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"In full honesty apple is not the same after Steve jobs passed away RIP. Samsung is more innovative and have overall a better ecosystem by now. And let's not even bring up the cameras, Samsung have leaped away from Apple."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Totally agree!
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im flipping to both sides! my android is in the mail!
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Surprised that security was not a category. Thanks
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Instead of making the conclusion, he confused all in the end. Anyway, as per my experience on this channel. He always praises Apple."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I watched this video again today & realize there is one more reason for me to switch toi android when I have the budget.. that is the keyboard typing.. here in Philippines there is no tagalog version for speak to type or keyboard gesture to type in any gadgets..editing & typing on an iphone is a disaster.. android is very smooth & easy when it comes to typing & editing mistyped words..
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"i agree or understand almost all your point except for the apps. there are so many apps for android that are not on the play store and thus not available at all on ios. i cannot inject payloads on my switch, pen-test networks or get custom/hacked versions of apps on ios and there are so many custom apps on android that i think there is no comparison."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iPhone has a better support they're expensive than android but they do last better it is True apple is coping everything from android each time more but Samsung is getting real good with the support thing anyways iPhone still having more support but also being expensier
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Im using both phone and they are work together :)
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"if you can't download media, torrenting ;-), Revanced patches, than you dont own your phone and with EyePhone you can't do that"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"It's just simple, Android is better for the majority of phone users because of the huge hardware choice in every budget segment."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"A lot of people have iphone and it makes me want to have one but I am just so used to Split screen, Pop up window, easily connecting my phone to my PC and move stuff around list can go on for a bit but yeah those features I can't let em go"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,As I have always said; You buy an iPhone for your mom and an Android for yourself!😉
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,It’s also hard to compare Apple and Android purely because there is so much variety with android with 100 different phones with different options compared to 1 iPhone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,today only i realized i have not been suscribed to this channel. lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I find Android is good if the expensive you buy and iPhone is good the recent model you buy
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Apps for IOS? What? On android you can literally download and install any apk. Only this can justify buying android for many people.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,No matter customization: Díme lo mejor!
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Add played before the video started saying “Sponsored by Apple” and an iPhone 15 trailer played so I knew the winner without watching.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I'm with android b/c I have a custom built pc.  I'm not a ""power user"" or use my phone on daily.  I watch youtube and transfer porn from my pc to my phone to watch while it's arm day.  Don't pretend like you don't do it too."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Apple phones feel expensive and solid. When I had the Ultra it felt cheap in the hand even though its not. Not to mention the phones look ugly. Sometimes I think to get one of the folding phones though, the new oneplus open looks sick.

There is also this really weird feel apps have on android that I can’t quite put into words. Its probably due to the way devs have to develop for only a small few phones on ios whereas android apps have to work with the hundreds of android phones.

I think whats most important to me is not how many features and customizable a phone is but rather how everything is packaged together. I have never been in a situation where I said “man I wish I had an android to have x feature”. But when I had the ultra I kept thinking “i dont have facetime, airdrop, etc.” Everything just feels so fluid and nice with ios. Everything just fits right."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Using an iPhone for the first time in my cell phone career/life, and I see lots of good design and UX. From a longtime Android user (mostly Samsung), it felt like I had to learn a different language the first day of use. A lot of common tasks weren't present, or they just didn't work as well - one of them being the keyboard. Typing on the iPhone right now, and it's just a bad, gross experience compared to the Android phones I've used. And the lack of being able to customize is frustrating. However, I do understand why some people like the prettiness of the iPhone and its interactions and transitions between apps. But am missing the highly customized experience you can get from an Android system. Oh and a calculator with history, and Samsung's sideswipe Edge panel. So useful."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Concerning security issues, the iPhone is far superior to Android. It's SAFER, harder to break its system and offers much more protection and privacy.  "
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,For every quality app on google play store there's at least 3-5 crap apps.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I recently switched to an iPhone from Android and the lack of customisation is really grinding my gear. Wann remove that stupid white bar on the bottom? Nope, not possible. Want to unlock your phone without swiping up the screen? Nope, not the Apple way. Why Apple WHYYYYYYYYYY?"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Ease of use only comes into play for the iPhone once you have learned and memorized the navigation for most apps that you use. Even after having iOS devices (iPhone and iPad Pro) for many years now, I still get confused how to go back a step in various apps, how to close menus or select options. And these navigation gestures sometimes even change depending on which device and what iOS version I’m using.
In android I always have my trusty back button or Consistent back gesture. In iOS those things change for every single app, sometimes you have to swipe down, Sometimes it’s pinching, sometimes it’s swiping left or right, it really gets confusing. Especially on iOS, many apps try to follow their design standards of minimalistic menus, so I often have to look up how to do things as buttons or navigation is not labeled. (Think about how many different options you need to learn to use Procreate.)
It’s honestly genius that they offer Apple support in all of their readily available stores, but I can’t help but think that it’s far more required for the devices due to the minimalistic approach of menus end navigation.
Add a big shout out to Apple for their many years of software support. My work phone is a super old iPhone 7+, which has been running and been supported with updates since already almost 6 years! For anything security related, Apple has a clear advantage and is leading the way in my opinion."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Where is the ""Hardware"" category Man !?"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"For the easy of use and security, I stay with the iPhone."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how about how smooth system works? apple lately not doing their job up to their own standards

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I really hate the way the Apple ecosystem works and it's limitations.  That is the main reason I am Android.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"on the ""apps"" category, if you took into consideration apk and developper mode for Android than that would've flipped the conclusion and an easy win for android."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"App dev here. The only reason Apple apps come before Android is because of Apples PIA review process that can take between 1 hour to a few weeks, and you'll never know which one it is. Google play review is fast and easy. So Apple first to get the stupid review process done then you roll out Android."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android is still my winner .. do i have an iphone YES .. was it my choice NO .. when i have a choice will i switch YES
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Dex killed the Ipad😂 just putting it out there.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Android is winner inMost important things for many users which are:
Battery
Screen
Camera"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Honestly I believe in the app category android has it because of the ability to download MOD apps
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I switched from android to ios so far it is great but little things like awful calculator, no call recording, etc. makes me want to switch back"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I love this and your observations. Android till death. I know it may be taboo to talk about apple culture... mum's the word... Apple=child safe.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Honestly Apple is a joke. They hold their customers prisoner. They're far behind and innovation constantly late to the party. Totally! Overrated overhyped never been the best at anything and they're inability to work with. The rest of the world shows what a scared, insecure little company they are. Not to mention they're a terrible company in general"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"If google had thier version of airdrop and not this wierd ""Nearby Share"" feature and something in the range of imessage where its first party, you can talk to essentially all google if not all android users for free and you dont have to go through 3rd party apps (Because there is so many and everybody uses something different), i think it would be over. I think google is probably the closest in that aspect as they have google pay, pixel watch, pixel phone, Nest, etc. I believe they are right there and probably have advantage if they could just focus on one thing at a time. 

Imagine if you could have chrome or a chrome widget on you computer that you can get phone notifications and send/recieve items to and from your phone and computer. Everyone uses google docs or sheets now. Their ui is prettly sleek. Idk i think google can be the apple killer if they play their cards right."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I'd say the ecosystem category is a tie. I can see the merit of the apple ecosystem having had some experience with it being so seamless. But the google ecosystem is also very powerful. For example being able to purchase a movie on youtube and accessing that on any device that can play youtube is amazing. Not every device has itunes so that integration is limited. Google services being so universal is a big pro along with the seamlessness of apple's ecosystem.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,What's your opinion on camera quality?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I swear iphone users say FaceTime is so perfect and no other way of video calling exists. I honestly use Facebook and snapchat to message more then actually message which both can video chat with.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"My beef with iPhone is the same as with modern cars.. if you are not really looking, you won't be able to tell which one it is particularly from the back. That is the primary reason I didn't fo for iPhone.. they all look the same.😊"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"my dude is an iphone fanboy , like how tf iphone won in app part , android can get tons of apk stuff"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,most important feature is the price of the phones which should be talked about.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I am not the world's biggest fan of Apple or Google, but I'm gonna side with Android 8 days a week. The software is better, more versatile, and allows you to pick which manufacturer you actually want to buy a phone from.

You can buy a cheaper phone for about $120 that meets your needs, or an over $1,000 phone with the most advanced chipset. You can always go somewhere in the middle of that as well. Apple does not have this flexibility, or at least not anymore tbh.

Also Apple is only embracing USB-C now, and only because the EU is forcing them. Seriously? It only took them 6 or 7 years longer than everyone else to get on board. Hooray!"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,He forgot to mention who has a better screen which is a huge thing in a smartphone & overall Camera experience  quality from high end android phones (which kill apple) or how about 65 + watt charging & battery life.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Android is not a phone, fix your title lol"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I love pixels but until they get the battery to last as long as an iPhone I can’t switch back. I need a long battery life which my 15 pro max definitely has
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,A fun follow up to this video would be … switching from apple to android (or vice versa)
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,As a day 1 android user who is constantly harassed about my green texts: I really like this video. You can't argue with it but it still comes down to personal preference. I'd really like to try an Iphone but I enjoy my Samsungs too much.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Apps shouldnt go to the iphone, you've got ton more apps for android, official ones and unnoficial ones, time and time again i see someone fancing a ""different"" version of youtube or an app to watch online tv not available for iphone for censorship reasons."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I disagree with the apps section, downloading random sh*t from the internet is way easier on android, and optimization is pretty much meaningless if the phone can handle it just fine."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Do you mean iOS ? Because Iphone is the device, android is the Os, and now Xiaomi and Huawei just left the Android, the question is how long “android” will still exist ? Apple just smiling know this fact"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,What a waste of time? Do u really think that anyone invested it their own system will change because of your biases?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Never once have I thought android was too complicated.. more options is just better.

Iphone is like a childs toy, like a games console, very confined/limited but optimized.

And android is like a PC in comparison, with more options and freedom."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I have to strongly disagree about the apps. While apple does get updates quickly they are also stuck behind the app store wall, third party app downloading is not a thing. This means that your accessibility to apps is censored on a corporate or governmental level. The ability to download APKs for Android is a hugely important feature for those that need or use it."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Not even close.  You can get a 1-2 year old Android phone for half price.  Problem solved.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I have been an iPhone user ever since iPhone 4 was released. I understand the fact iPhone has always had the same feature like forever and added few tweaks to the new ISO updates. However I like the fact iPhone is easy to use and easier to get around. I have an old Samsung tablet. I find getting round the apps and finding what you are looking for is little confusing and complicated. Whereas an iPhone, in my opinion is straight forward. Of course using the same type of phone, you’ll get use to it the more you use it. I just like how iPhone is just simple and sleek."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"This made me reconsider everything, I thank you so much!"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"It's not impossible I'm holding a Samsung Galaxy A51 and a brand new iPhone 15. Forget the camera, battery, sound quality, nice perks, but the functionality of the phone is what actually matters. It literally takes me more steps to do the exact same things on the 15. I'm going to keep using it until the next Samsung comes out and trade it in.  This is NOT debatable, at all and the people who are debating it are simping for the status.

Edit: Ease of use is basically what i was talking about and that only applies for people who have had iPhones before. New users to phones will have a better time with droid.

I also couldn't give less of a sh*t about updates"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,This video was suggested to me after watching the collab you did last year with Mrwhosetheboss on this same topic. Interesting to see how things have progressed since then.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Funny how I saw this coming. Apps and accesories are easily android win, but you had to give win to apple so they get to win as a whole."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Only thing in my opinion you missed is the customer support thing, it really depends where you live there is a lot of countries that do not even have apple stores, where if you have an android there is representation literally everywhere globally!

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Let me say one thing wahtever the result is from any reviwer it os always biased . specially for iPhone .
 
You may think yes based on the categories mentioned it's correct ,    Customizations , Features , Updates and Support , Apps, Ecosystem ...

But in the first place this is not the only review categories or the biggest.

There are more important  stuffs . Like installing amy app I wamt from waherever I get ,  don't control me don't tell me I can't install that app because it's from an Unkown source . Shut the fk up and install it you are not my parent .

and I don't give a F about eco system , I like the freedom of Android , I get any headphone / earbud / smart watch , anything  will work . fine with my Android device . 

Also USB Debugging  mode , and developper mode . 

Android device is something you own and you are free to use as you want . 

iphone is something that controls you to use it as they want ."

What if I say I want a 300$ phone for my daily use?!

Is this society gonna reject me??😂😂
Lol..
Android is definitely the best option as it caters to people dealing with any budget range.

And it's not even a lack of money or anything!
I just deem it impractical to spend more than 300$ on a phone!
Go figure!
Give me an Iphone that cheap😂
Android all the way..

I told a coworker ot was to hard to use and i liked andriod better. His reply to me was crazy he said iPhone was for dummies morw or less. He said Android was more comlex which i thought was funny. I guess we all get use to one or the other.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"It's really difficult to compare Android vs iPhone. Android can be delivered over the network, iPhone needs physical delivery. iPhone have a better camera as Android doesn't have any, it only contain the apps to control it. Android can be modified a lot, iPhone will always be the same, only iOS can change.
But the main difference is the price. iPhone is quite costly, while Android is usually included with the phone for free."

SO  What?"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Ease of use is relevant in Year 1 not 17. Nowadays that ease of use for iOS is akin to a kid mode lol. If you don't know how to navigate a phones UI at this point, iOS has no benefit over Android."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"You're legit, great review! Love the ending. In the end, the phone is an extension of you. Pick the one that fits you. Neither is inherently better."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Great video. I have one major disagreement though: apps. The view about focusing on iOS is correct, but the idea that only some small niche apps are the difference is wrong. There are entire categories of apps missing on iOS. For example, emulators. This is not some small thing. PPSSPP on Android has over 100 million downloads. Others have millions or tens of millions. The entire world of emulation gaming only exists on Android. There are no emulators in the App Store, and jailbreaking isn't going to get you the same either plus you're already out of the ecosystem at that point. 

Another category missing is desktop usage. Samsung Dex is one of the examples, but not the only one. You can run full blown Linux systems on your phone, connect it to a big screen, and have an actual desktop user experience. Andronix alone has over a million downloads, so it's a decent size audience. The whole idea of turning your phone into a desktop doesn't exist in iOS.

One more: custom launchers. Nova and Microsoft launchers have 50+ million downloads each. There are multiple launchers with, again, millions and tens of millions of downloads each. Adding them all together there are hundreds of millions of people using custom launcher apps, and the entire category of custom launchers is missing in iOS. 

Then on top of that you start getting into specialty apps. Say you want a terminal on your phone. You can install Termux on Android, and execute stuff on the go if needed. There's no equivalent in iOS. Termux has over a million downloads too, so not too shabby. Granted, this isn't for the general public, but it has to be acknowledged that Android offers something for a lot of niches, while iOS only targets the general, to put it that way. Basically the bottom line is pretty much any app made for iOS can be made for Android too, but the reverse isn't true. This should give the edge back to Android in my opinion. Yes, your Instagram updates will come to iOS first, but when you have whole categories, with tens or even hundreds of millions of combined downloads on Android, missing in the App Store, I don't see how that point can be given to iOS."

Why cant you PAUSE during video recording??? I don’t want to use 3rd party apps to do this!

Why cant we put the APP ICONS wherever we want in our screen without other icons filling up the gaps. With android you can put them in a way that you can see your background picture better instead of all the app icons blocking your family picture.

Ease of use goes to apple. 
Quality of ecosystem and consistency(you mentioned apple don’t change unless there is a reason)

As an android user myself, I will never say the iphone releases are exciting for now and also iphones are never easy to use for me. Androids have way better shortcuts and options. But I will say iphone optimizes the apps better than android and ecosystem connections or continuity is a little more seamless than android or pc world.

I used to spend hours back in the day customizing my HTC or my Razor. But I just don’t have patience for that shit anymore. I still have very basic widgets on my iPhone. I also found that I no longer like custom icons because many times they become hard to identify. So this aspect of Android doesn’t move me."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Came to figure out if I should keep my android but now I'm searching for that floating plant in the background
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,When is dex going to Apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,It’s because Samsung did all of it first lol. Apple wants to be THAT DIFFERENT yet there ways and ideas still suck in my opinion. They may win in sales because hey it’s 2023 everyone’s gotta have the newest iPhone. It’s an icon. Talk about Apple and how they make people’s phones slower because there’s a new phone coming out. They do it every year. Apple is basic. Basic. Android in every way is better in my opinion
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"You may not realise but most people will certainly care about ecosystem, at least they will be heavily impacted by it . If you have AirPods, MacBook, Apple TV you will definitely have a better experience using An iPhone. What sucks is that Apple locks you in their ecosystem because it’s really good that it’s hard to escape or use with other devices that are not Apple made, and that feeling of being stuck with them is what sucks for me. Apple clearly shows signs of monopolising practices which doesn’t make us the winner because it doesn’t promote competition, so it’s the consumers the ones ultimately impacted"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Yup I go with Apple Ecosystem because I share photos, apps, and music with my family."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I’ve recently bought an iPhone for the first time. I gotta say the Android back gesture with the thumb is the thing I miss the most about Android. Notifications icons on the top bar is also something I miss a lot. I was expecting more from iOS
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Customization for me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,This presentation was well done. Great argument. Very objective.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,privacy and security would have been an interesting category..

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,What about cost
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Iphones and apple products have become the product for not-so-tech-savvy cool kids and old people that needs the it-just-works phone that apple provides. Samsung makes better phones, but thanks to Steve Jobs and the way he markeded Apple products especially in the US, it's the coolest most ""in"" phone you can buy. Here i Europe most people have Android phones, and even more in Asia."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,There are more powerful niche apps you can use in Android because of .APK sideloading.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,On updates/support. Apple artificially slows down their older phones so you will have to buy new ones. That's a big negative in my book.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,A lot of the same apps cost more on ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"You should also consider repairability etc. There android phones wins by a landslide, just from the fact that they're not owned by Apple."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Excitement category is an oversimplification. @MKBHD you unremarkably watered down this one. This category is what has brought to life folding phones. I'd call this category Innovation and/or invention. The most daring technologies premiere on Android. Folding phones for example would still be an impossible thought if we all lived in apple's world. Android pushes technology forward.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I use iPhone because some niche apps, like control for specific hardware, like say stereo or tech stuff often get the iOS app much earlier than a android app. And they get it working much better. Nowadays I always have a iPad around so that could be used instead, with shared internet from a android phone as long it can do that. But it’s easier to have the app available on the phone."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"ease of use , i semi agree, ios might be easier to get into , but i dont think once you get hang of both its easier, sending images on bulk to anyone on whatsapp is big example , its like 2 steps on android , on ios its hell. and same goes for transfering files between pc and your phone , android is much better."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,You spoke too soon on the the security updates lol. Google pixel 8 pro as you already know as 7 years of updates
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"In my opinion though, the thing about ""ease of use"" is that I still feel like Android can be as easy or as complicated as you want it to be"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"you're mistaken, we have focus modes on samsung, named modes"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,updates now go to android with google offering 7  years!
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I love this approach. It's universal method that can help to make decisions! Thanks for sharing this idea.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Here's a big one for me: iTunes. I have a massive music library. No other music player syncs such a large collection to any device better than iTunes does with an iPhone, nor does any other music app on PC or Mac have anything like Smart Playlists (Zune and WinAmp both have something kind-of similar, but nothing remotely as fully-featured as Smart Playlists in iTunes)."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Have You ever tried to find something with Files app on iOS?. This app can not find file that You have on the screen for example in another file manager like Documents but not only. Files is opposite to OSX Finder which finds easyly names of files even inside disk indexed by manager of external drives etc Android file manager works similar to finder. Backup is easy like a snap and does not matter where I want to store my files. IOS is a colorfull toy vs Android as real productivity tool. I work on Mac with Windows also, iPad pro, but the only iPhone /5s/ I owned left unopened and soon became someone toy."

But, if the rat given many ways from one hole to other, it will fail and pass and fail and pass and eventually will pass. What I am gonna say that apple's ease of use is for people who don't like changes."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"My one gripe is you sold short the concept of ecosystem in Android.  It's an open ecosystem that allows you to jump from brand to brand and to combine brands between products (like phone, watch, tablet, PC etc) and even services/websites. I have a gmail account that follows me everywhere and simplifies my life so much. The idea of being locked in to IOS/MacOS will always be the biggest deal-breaker for me."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"iOS still does support only few languages, no  respect to smaller languages. Android supports much more languages.
Did you newer used a phone with 2 sims? Try and use - not just simple calling, try switching between lines, SMS one or another etc. 
How to use secure folder in iOS? Its not just to secure files, photos etc., its to have second set of apps with different google account (private and bussiness). Just great stuff only in Android.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Thank you for your sharing. And what about performance and durability between flagship phones?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"If u like communism get iPhone, if u like democracy get Android."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I just got my first iPhone, the latest and greatest iPhone 15, I’ve been using Android for at least 13 years.

I made the switch because I wanted to try it and give it it’s chance, plus I never liked the phones and the OS design in android, and I found the iPhones always appealing aesthetically.

And so far, I really hate it, some things will need some getting used to I think, I was really annoyed by some apps not having any way of getting backups from Android to iOS, but the most annoying for me is missing the back gesture from any edge, and the implementation of going back in iOS, I need to do lots of gymnastics to get back to the previous screen, and it’s hard on the Plus model.
Each app has different views implementation and uses different ways of going back, like sometimes the gesture from the other edge doesn’t work and you need to press the back button all the way on the top left, sometimes you get no back button nor gesture and you need to do a down gesture, or sometime an X button on the top right, it’s soo confusing…

I find my self taking a lot more time to do anything on the iphone, and even after getting used to this I don’t see it beating the small swipe from the edge your thumb is already sitting on.

I’m really considering returning the iphone and getting a pixel 8 pro for the same price, I really don’t agree with the ease of use verdict, it’s really a lot easier to use an adroid.

The only thing I like so far is face ID, and the good animations and theme in iOS, it’s so slick you don’t need to customize anything, but other than that Android beats it in evry category."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Can u give me Google pixal 8 pro as a gift
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,IPhone. And I didn’t watch the video. Thankfully.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"This was a good way to approach this increasingly silly topic. It seems like the arguing has settled down a little compared to a few years ago, but I just don't get caring about what phones other people use. So I like how you put the viewer in the focus here."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,How do you possibly use Samsung as the Android ecosystem when Google Pixel/Tablets/Home/Nest Thermostat/Cameras/Doorbells/Audio Devices/Wifi Mesh Networks exist? What?! How do you use Samsung for that example and not Google Marques?

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I wish android phone app could allow to dial whatsapp directly and also show missed whatsapp calls and vieber telegram or other messagin apps
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i do wish the damn app devs would give android more love for their apps it pisses me off that they only give a shit about ios and android is the bottom of the barrel os that they dont care about which really annoys me and everyone for some reason thinks apple is domingating the world market which they arent theyre just dominating the american market which annoys me cause android has far better use than iphone does
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Actually USB type C is there with iPhone too, and you could also mess with the lockscreen"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iOS is great for streamlined experiences for a premium price but it's very limiting. Android gives you choice and great hardware but can be inefficient.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Too bad with each android update, it's getting less customization options and dumbed down."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Sorry, easy to use to iphone? Have you tried to plugin yojr iphone to a pc? Or create a backup on your pc when there is not enough free space on the disk itunes want to save it to? It is really really easy to use, sure."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"So far the only thing I really have a gripe about is ease of use as a category, you don't judge a pair of shoes by your ability to walk. That's just basically like your ability to comprehend menus and knowing what things do, if you just don't know and don't care to know go with Apple if you don't mind learning something but with Android"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I've always been an android boy. And not because I wanted to. Iphones are just to expensive 🎉

5: Just no. There are way more apps on android and they are as good as on iphone. Also the developers  are doing it cause it is easier to get on play store than on app store
6. What on iphone is exiting
7. Also google, samsung, huawei, xiaomi and every other brand has their own ecosystem that works perfectly fine with their devices"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I'd love you to do Pixel v. iPhone once the Pixel 8 is out.  I believe it solves a lot of the issues that you've put apple ahead on.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I had 8 iphones my latest phone was my first Samsung! The 256gb S10e with a 512gb micro SD card! It never runs out of storage for thirty dollar and change you just put in a new card! And my phone is set to stop charging at 80 percent! My battery is still going strong after 4.5 years where as my iphones gave me all kings of battery issues after 3 years! And I did not want an infrared laser shining in my eyes every time I needed to open my phone... Which is A LOT! So eternally grateful for the fingerprint scanner in the power button! Unfortunately apple no longer makes a phone that suits my needs! As always Marques Brownlee thanks for all the great content!

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,What about adding storage card? You add it easily on Android and have to buy cloud storage on iphone. Also how about adding music to the phone. Android wins all the way.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I own both an android phone and an apple iPhone and what I can say is I prefer iPhones because the way the camera looks is so realistic.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Sorry, but for ease of use, the way apple does a lot of icons or moving around the phone, it's just not very intuitive, which makes it not an ease of use, so many apps you have to figure out what the icons actually mean, meanwhile for android, it just makes sense, most of the time at least, once in a while they mess it up too. But generally Android makes so much more sense with ease of use wise."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Nice review brotha!   I totally agree.  I had an Android for many years and switch to IOS.  In the of the day,  its about what works for you. To me it's like buying a Firearm.  You don't rely on other people's suggestions on what you should get.

I'm also tech-savy enough I can easily deal with Android and do not value the Apple 'ease of use' that much when it limits customization, compatibility and advancements in tech..

That said, for those who say cloud is the answer, it's good to remember that being too reliant on cloud has one big disadvantage - the cloud depends on the Internet. Having everything on cloud has its convenience, but you also need to ensure you have connectivity. That may seem a given in this day & age, but that's simply complacency. There can be situations you have no connectivity, rare but still a possibility."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"My exeperience living in Australia where some of the apple feature won't really matter is that if someone is only a bit tech savvy, 90% of the times they have an android phone! I also strongly believe most people globally pick up iphones simply on the ""ease of use basis"" and knowing the new iphone matches what i was doing on my old iphone hence not as tech savy or excited about new OS or features.

But i agree that the real winners are customers here who get benefits of competiotion and it's real stupid to take sides and be closed minded to actual benefits for each individual. i.e blue vs. Green bubble debate in US!!  I personally use android phones and mac laptops where i believe they each shine in their respective fields...🔦"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I have know quite a number of android users who are really iphone haters. They always have the perception that people who owns an Apple is because the branding, big hype, showing off etc. They feel that they are smart in the way that they can buy a cheaper Android phone and do quite the same thing. They are so self centered and they feel that every single thing android is better than iphone. They even say that Android is easier to use which is totally untrue. I been telling them Apple is much more straight forward in the setting and overall while Android is more complicated but they allow a lot of customization which may not be easy to for less tech person. Can't Android user just stick to what they like and stop making accusation. I have both iphone and Android phone. To me, I trust the security for iphone and I do my personal banking with iphone. And I play games on Android. Android has too many security issues when they allow user to install any app from the web or scanning QR codes which might be scam. Whereas iphone can only download and install app from apple app store. One thing for sure iphone is always very premium in price but for the security sake, I rather pay higher price for iphone than spending lower for Android and get scammed and lost even more money. It happed here in Singapore so many times where scammer  leave QR code to install so called survey app to get freebies and people got cheated ten of thousands. But end of the days I think everyone should respect what phone people like to use and not always think that they have the best choice. Everyone has their own priorities."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Good stuff, as always. There are plenty of reasons I'm all in on Apple, but maybe more than anything else, I come at it through the ecosystem argument — but from a different angle than this video explored. Our lives are full of different types of technology for different purposes: phones, tablets, watches, media streaming devices, speakers, headphones, and, of course, actual computers. To me, the greater consistency and ""synergy"" I can have among my various devices, the better, and the ONLY company that makes serious versions of all of these — both hardware AND software, at that — is Apple, and they happen to do it really, really well. Microsoft makes computers and sort of tablets, but no phones anymore. Google makes phones and tablets but no *real* computers (sorry, Chromebooks just don't count).

Even if an individual product were lacking in one area or another compared to a competitor (Siri, for example, is a knock against the HomePods despite their incredible sound quality), the benefit of feature consistency and compatibility across an entire ecosystem of devices like this is huge and, for me, cannot be overstated. Universal Control is honestly still a mind-blowing feature to me that I use more or less all day at work, sharing keyboard/mouse across two computers and an iPad with the ability to easily drag and drop between them 🤯. Plus Continuity Camera, like Marques mentioned, and the ability to copy/paste between devices, or hand off particular activities to another device, or the fact that my AirPods Pro now seamlessly and instantly switch automatically to whatever device I start playing audio on, etc. I could go on and on. I use this stuff *all the time* and most of it wouldn't even be possible if all of my products were from different manufacturers. But even at a more basic level, it means there's one basic approach and philosophy behind the various OS implementations, meaning I don't have to learn 6 or 7 completely separate ways to interact with my devices. Powerful technology necessarily introduces complexity into our lives, and I'm all about reducing that complexity, reducing the friction, wherever I can. Apple helps by providing a common design philosophy and (to some extent) design language across these various devices, and also just by [usually] being really good at making their devices user-friendly.

And, of course, it doesn't hurt that Apple's products are usually rock solid, polished, extremely performant, and (in my personal opinion) far more pleasant to use than equivalent products. But yeah, for me, it ultimately comes back to the ecosystem and the fact that there IS truly no other competition on that front."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I feel like people use the Iphone's for ease of use it's just so easy if people want a little customization then they'll move over to android. I think once Apple releases the walls of the customization then you'll have a much bigger influx of people using the Iphone.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Stability. I’ve noticed Apple is WAY more stable than android. Everything is polished and works flawlessly. Android.. not so much.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,U r iPhone biased person
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,And Apple CarPlay
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"To me personally the most important is typing in more than 4 languages and editing what I type, which is really very bad on iPhones. Even with Gboard from Google, you can't have more than 4 keyboards and on Android I have 10 (!). To get to the position of text that needs to be corrected on iPhone takes much more time than on Android. So this is the most important to me. 

The second customizations. Maybe not even customizations, but to turn off (do not disturb is useless on iPhones), remove (app icons from the main screen I don't want there, removing the complete screen on the left side (if I don't want it, 8 want to be able to remove it, it's my phone), place things the way I want (icons grouped on screens, not all sorted the way apple want me to have them).

Upgrades/updates, don't really care.

Apps are incomparable. Some work better on Android, some on Apple. We as developers keep them the same for both OS. But it's really more difficult to create an app that will work the same on every Android than to do the same on iOS. But flagships or Android phones in the same price range as iPhones are supported the same.

Ecosystem - I like it when devices work together, but 8 hate to be forced to stay with one brand. If I like Sony headphones the best, Garmin watches the best, etc, I want them to work good together and this isn't the case with iPhones.

Excitement? I don't care about it at all.

Ease of use? To me personally Androids are more logical and easier to use. I almost never had to search for how something is done for Android where with the iPhone I am searching it all the time. iPhones aren't easier to use, there is just enough users that had a similar problem who asked it in the internet and you can find the answer or you find the answer which tells you that simply can't be done on iPhones. I can't remember of a feature that isn't available on my Android and it is available on the iPhone.

Features - iPhones don't have anything that would convince me to buy one (or better to use them, because I have an iPhone and an iPad but I'm using them only for testing the app we're developing, my every day phone is an Android).

There are still two points that make iPhones the better choice. Covers (the amount of different covers for iPhones is much bigger than for any other phone and that makes it girls' favorite phone). The other is the value. In three years you get half of the new price for your old iPhone. For Samsungs it's 1/4 and for Sonys it's 1/3. This makes it much easier to buy a new iPhone every three years than with other phones and mobile operators offer them all the time in rates over 3 years where some brands aren't offered at all.

And to end my comment, I'm using Sony phones since the beginning (I again have Samsungs, Huaweis, iPhones for testing purposes), but the phone that convinces me the most us Sony Xperia 1 II in my case. I can't find reasons to upgrade because it offers everything I need and it's 3 years old already. And none of operators in my country offers Sony phones.

For me the clear winner is a Sony phone, Xperia 5 or 10. The next would be a Pixel and then I don't know. For average users iPhone is the easiest choice. They won't get mad if something isn't possible to do."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Never understood this ease of use argument for iPhone. I find apple incredibly hard and frustrating to use while android very intuitive.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Tried galaxy a few years ago and I went back to iPhone 6 months later. Android just not my vibe.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Spoiler! Not apple. 
Because Apple unlawfully records and uses consumers’ personal information and activity on its consumer mobile devices and applications (“apps”), even after consumers explicitly indicate through Apple’s mobile device settings that they do not want their data and information shared.

However, I always have my Android phones that also use on the side.

If Google got serious about preventing apps that have hidden malware in them, from being listed in their Google Play App Store, I would switch in a heartbeat FULLY back to Android.

Apple does a wonderful job of preventing apps w/hidden malware from EVER being listed in their App Store.

Google could do the same if they wanted but instead they are lazy & rely on 3rd party malware security companies to screen the apps AFTER they have been made available to the public by way of being listed on the Google Play App Store.

Google needs to get it’s butt sued in a major class action lawsuit that results in them having to pay out millions $.  

Then you would finally see them take app malware seriously!"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Samsung ecosystem automatically takes the point. They work with other ecosystems too. Its an open ecosystem it isnt enclosed like apples ecosystem. They work with windows and many other brands.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,This video helped me to know that the best phone for me is an Android one
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Apple เจาะตลาด บน จะแข่งต้อง focus ตลาดเดียวกัน
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,It's basically Windows vs Linux.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"For someone as me, who expect his phone to last 3-5 years, longevity is one of major selling point. I feel like android phones are for ppl who like experiments, deep customization and switch phones more often (every year or two) because android phones just starting to fell appart in longer term. My Honor 20 pro just fell appart both hardware and software wise after 3 years. I had some 2 xiaomi phones at my previous work that first died after 1,5 years 2nd in 6 months. Also had Samsung S6 that lasted me for 2 years.
In my new job there was discarded iPhone 6 lying in a drawer for about year or two. I was curiuos to try iOS so I charged it up, turned it on and was shocked how snapy the phone was. It felt like a brand new. Solid body, no cracks, nothing. It also downloaded its latest updates.
I wish I had this kind of experience with any of my previous android phones.
I still cant decide between S23U and iPhone15 Pro Max as my new phone which should last me for 5 years."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"One category that doesn’t apply to most people is accessibility. I will only use Apple because Android just doesn’t work for me. Although some people really like Android for that same reason. Everything here is down to personal preference. I just like the ecosystem and the simplicity of it. You don’t really have to think when you’re setting up your phone because it’s all built in. Sure I bet customization can be fun, its just not for me. Everyone’s opinion is valid."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Not putting an icon where I want drives me crazy on iPhone. We all know they’re better on the bottom.

I'm a techy nerd. just like Marques, but when it comes to a smartphone appliance, I just don't want to put much thought into it. I want to set it and forget it. I'll put my mental energy into other, more important, things."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I have to disagree on ease of use. After having used both android and iPhone I’ve found that most of my regular actions take at least one more click on iPhone than android. For instance, if I’m texting and want to call the person, on Android you just hit the call button. On I phone you have to click the person’s name which takes you to their contact and from there you can click their phone number to call. That’s just clunky and twice as many steps for doing a very basic thing. I find this is true of nearly every major thing I do on the iPhone. It takes at least one more step to accomplish it."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Nope stop stop… i’m done you said it the iphone wins. We are not friends them miniature little features cause apple to win in your book.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The thing that bothers me about Apple is whenever Apple does everyone follows. I'm not really into iPhone since there the same phone with limited customization and features. I like Samsung because of the customization, features, and is part of Android. Samsung started copying Apple by getting rid of the features. I never understood why Samsung drop the headphone jack. I got the Galaxy Buds and they broke down 6 months later. 120 dollars for a Galaxy Bud to break down in 6 months is kind of a rip off."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"ecosystem depends on where you are. it's essentially a win for Apple only, and ONLY, in the US. for the average non-Americans, as you said, something as simple as USB-C compatibility can be a more important ""ecosystem""."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android better than ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Samsung has ""focus"" modes for at least a year"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"This debate has always been flawed since its basically one phone versus all the others. When it comes to apps, the issue is way deeper than which ecosystem gets priority. Quality control on Android is non-existant. If you want to get stranded on your holiday with your mobile banking app that doesn't work anymore due to an update, go for android. That's what I learned from publishing apps on both stores for years. Apple is clearly the premium product smartphone at the moment, everything else feels cheap and simply doesn't work as well. I'll gladly skip the 10x zoom to have a working set of apps that my life depend on."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Longtime iPhone user, switched a few years ago to S10, loved the phone and customisation… however I have gone back to iPhone because the tight integration of Ecosystem and Apple Pay was the primary reason I switched, Samsung Pay and Google Pay worked 50% of the time.

I hate that Apple is a rip off, I hate that Apple hasn’t improved its iCloud since day one.

However I know what I’m getting, like a steady horse and not something that bolts"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android customization is good. iPhone everything just works. I don’t have to worry about how my iPhone is going to act.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"One thing that was key for me, and I strongly disagree with your opinion is regarding apps. While it is true that the vast majority of apps run better and receive updates faster on IOS, Android just has access to more app and more variety. I've been debating to get an ipad for awhile and the only thing stopping is that I wouldn't get access to a few APK apps that are vital for me.
Besides that, I completely agree with your takes. Great video as always!"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"You didn’t rate stability. Android, even on stock google phones, is buggy as hell. I got my mother in law a pixel in 2019 and out of the box, installing  WhatsApp couldn’t work. An empty phone with just WhatsApp installed was unstable. Had to reboot and reinstall WhatsApp. Something like that would never happen on iOS. Seeing her phone a year later, it looked like a boomer’s virus infected windows pc. Loads of notifications, bizarre behavior, slow as hell."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"If you add three more categories: Film making, Photography, and Technical specifications I think the latest Samsung will usually always blow the iPhone out of the water on all three. As far as ease of use is concerned I kind of agree on the compatibility side of things where everything just works in terms of the system not crashing, but in terms of being able to do simple things like filmmaking or setting up playlists for your music, transferring things to and from the iCloud or to your computer to free up space, well the iPhone ecosystem really sucks, to put it bluntly and often fails and lets you down. You will tend to have more crashes with an Android device overall than an iOS one but the iOS device is very limited in what it can do. There are some things that you just can't do on the standard iOS system and its default programs, without the need for the use of other apps, and that can get very messy. Whereas, with the Android phone you don't have those problems of needing to use third-party apps. I would actually say the Android devices particularly the Samsung ones are ahead of the Apple iPhones in 6 out of 10 areas."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android is always the winner in my book. Android for life

I think that apple wins that one, and not andriod, as, well, some of the ""features"" like battery management etc, is well, a setting, a customising thing, not a feature 
also, no sat SMS, no mention of the health things, or crash alerts etc, those are feature that, while in the sense of sat sms, hardware, but crash alerts that is a true life saving feature, and to my best awareness, there is nothing on android that matches that"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"hey Marques, would you say out loud that the android has the technical debt, being slower (at a daily use after some time), draining more power (iphones have less mahs, but more screen time), and starting to lose at the customization department to ios?

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"What makes me stick to Android phones as much as I do is just how free you feel with customization.
You will always be able to mess with both software and hardware  of your phone, since you can install external memory and phone parts with no consequences. Not to mention the presence of apks! You say quality over quantity, but the real quantity of apps on both sides is usually trimmed by region restrictions. Apks fix that very easily.
iPhone on the other hand? You are heavily cuffed by Apple, since no SD cards means you will have to rely on external acessories or iCloud (which... discredits iPhones in the ""ecosystem"" category, since cloud storage = MASSIVE servers = electricity to run = more carbon emissions). And the various issues with the non repairability is extremely funny

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I was given an iPhone at work and tried for a long time to do without Android, but finally gave up and bought a cheap Chinese UMIDIGI 3G Plus with which I can finally listen to music from YouTube and other applications and websites that do not have equalizer. Android allows developers to create special equalizer apps - but iOS sorry no. I also like to listen to music and audiobooks before bed at MINIMUM volume using my own rather than Apple's super expensive bluetooth headphones. On the iPhone, the volume goes from zero to immediately too loud for me - precise volume control is completely impossible. On Android, I can go into developer mode and do a double volume control - I can adjust the volume on the phone itself and separately with the buttons on the headphones. On the iPhone, pressing the buttons on the headphones just changes the volume on the phone itself. This is also the default mode on recent versions of Android - but on Android I can get rid of this mode and have a more fine-tuned volume setting. As for iOS, all I see is yelling and complaining from users who have been asking Apple for years to make finer volume control - but Apple ignores them. I recognize that the iPhone has its advantages, especially for undemanding users, and iPhones make great video (without allowing you to record it on a micro SD card). But if you want to use the phone for listening to music and audiobooks - it's better to buy Android where you can use SD card up to one terabyte and you can just take and insert this card into your computer to copy files like a regular external disk, where you can run an equalizer application that will improve the sound even if you listen to free YouTube, and most importantly - you can adjust the volume at your will and not at Apple's will to sell you headphones for the price of 3 Chinese phones - each of which for me personally is more convenient than iOS. In general, iPhone is more expensive to use, Apple always wants you to buy and pay. Android is cheaper and more flexible, especially for users willing to tinker with their phone."

Why? Cause you probably won't find any android phone that hasEVERY feature mentioned in this video. Comparing iphone to a particular android phone would be a much better way.

Cause if we compare iphone to a pixel(for example) i wouldn't say that pixel is more customizable. Yea, you can make a few tweaks, but nothing critical. They don't even let us hide that annoying google search bar from the main screen..."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android is way easier to use than iPhone. Going back in apps is so unintuitive and having pop ups constantly confuse people about storage and apple pay makes the ease of use for a layman very annoying.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I don't think apple wins in ecosystem, they actually lack, if you stick with one brand you will be just fine with Samsung or Google or apple ecosystem but the best thing is with android u can have pixel phone with a Xiaomi tablet and Samsung smartwatch and windows laptop, they will all ""speak"" to each other with Google services, so you can chose any brand and device fits you better and you know they will work together, for apple it only works when u use their products as soon as u prefer the another device apart from apple it will be difficult the add it to your apple ecosystem, I know they made this on purpose but for me it is not an advantage, it is actually a down point for their ecosystem, at least that's just my point"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The apps thing was really not thought through. What about apps that arent available on ios? Well your SOL. On Android just get the APK. 

Several apps and games are available for free on Android and are not on apple. 

You can also do development work on Androids, force changes on apps and even do debugging if you're loading custom apps. 

There are more Androids sold, which means greater app support and availability and longer term too, because developers stand to make more despite the differences from phone to phone. Apple also nails devs more on transactions. 

What if you're super concerned about privacy? Apple got a terrible rating on TOS;DR. With Android, if you're concerned you can remove all system apps with adb or flash a custom image of Android and choose the apps and access they have. There's a reason Android is winning the race.

I was able to optimize my parents phones since they were not wanting to change the ones they use, the extended life you can get from an Android is crazy good whereas the Iphone becomes a very expensive paperweight whenever they no longer support the older devices."

I understand apps are often made with iOS in mind first, but really, when an app that's free on the play store costs $20 on the Apple app store, it's really not even a competition for me.
I like the app store, and I'm swapping back and forth between the Xr and an S20 FE depending on what I need at the time (family member who texts a lot is on iphone and when he sends images they're always blurry unless I'm using the iphone thanks to apple's insistence on not changing to the newer messaging protocols. Galaxy when I need to take a photo of something because, while iOS camera software is really good, the camera on the Xr is... not) but really, as someone studying languages, the inability to use my account on the iphone really hinders that for me.
Niche case, sure."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"This is an interesting exercise.  I love all OSes except iOS.  My big problem with iOS is all the artificial limitations.  The A16 is useless if you can't even do basic things like split screen apps or copy photos directly from your phone to your computer.  I also think SIMPLE is often conflated with EASY.  iOS has less options, but for me, this missing options make the product harder to use.  The UI cannot be scaled smaller, Safari is the only browser engine, apps can only be installed from the App Store.  These are all things that make using an iPhone an infuriating experience for me.  As a result my iPhone 13 sits in the box 99.9% of the time.  My iPad Mini 6 has been relegated to YouTube duty; although Stage Manager would have helped even if it is a weak solution.  I did this and had Android 17 to 6 with iOS getting 5 of the 6 points on updates.  Updates are important to me, but I use Pixels to bridge the gap a bit.  Also, Apple's ecosystem (a 1 point category for me) is awesome, but it is not perfect.  I tried Universal Control a lot the first month it came out and OVER HALF THE TIME my mouse would not connect to my iPad Mini 6 AT ALL.  Not sure what that's about.  I think Apple can really bridge the features and customization gap by hiding the things behind one expert mode toggle or something.  Then maybe iOS would be worth using.  Also...  Android is super simple to use with defaults.  No curveballs, atleast with Pixels at a minimum.  Customization is OPTIONAL not required."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Good video and I agree 100% agree with the conclusion that which OS is better is always dependant on the individual because both have their pros and cons, however there are definitely glaring ""categories"" that you've missed out, including privacy, security, and price. The first two are definitely a win for Apple by a very long mile (and 2 of the main reasons why I personally ended up going with iOS over Android after finally having to leave my beloved Windows Phone behind), whereas price is definitely a clear winner for Android just due to the vast variety of different price points.

There are other things I personally wish you had delved into deeper like the hardware fragmentation of Android or the lack of sideloading on iOS, but those aren't necessarily as important things for everyone as the 3 points I made above."

I started with iPhone, because it was a game changer, then after a couple of years, Android caught up and iPhone basically didn't have nothing else to offer except getting more expensive.

Some of the best apps we've ever gotten were only made possible because of the unique culture that ios development nourished. 
I still remember when the best apps started on iOS and then when they became popular would get adapted to Android: apps like Instagram before being bought by facebook, more simple apps like Clear that made regular tasks a pleasure to use, Apollo (rip), and even games like Letterpress. Quality over quantity indeed.

I won't even mention the nightmare of compatibility devs face trying to make a non standardized ecosystem on the android side, like the lack of a good camera api and why snapchat had the worst photo quality ever for a solid decade."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"When I tried to enter the Samsung ecosystem, when the S21 Ultra had recently launched, I hated it so much.

I bought the Galaxy Watch Classic (I think it was the 4), the Galaxy Ear Buds (the beans), and the S21 Ultra. I started the configuration of the three devices and every action that I was doing was raising a different error. When I was pairing the Galaxy Watch, I was just informed that an error occurred. Only in the third time that it would properly finish the configuration. But after it was configured, the notifications weren't arriving. The buds, well, it has the same connection that Apple does and that works fine. But they were disconnecting for so many times that I just lost the count.

It could be because it was new? Yes, sure. But I've never had such bad experience with Apple devices before.

And don't get me wrong, I honestly don't like Apple. The Macbook I use it solely because I'm a developer and it's much better to work with MacOS. And I don't play games at all so Windows it's just not my thing. And the iMessage, I just can't enjoy that because I don't live in the US and all my friends and contacts use WhatsApp.

But truth be told: in Apple, everything just works.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Excellent balanced review. Funny enough, I use a Samsung Z Flip 5 but have so much fun with my Apple iPad. Although others have tried to convince me to give the iPhone a try, even just to say I've tried it, I am still not wholly convinced."

android wins by sideloading alone."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The iPhone is the phone you definitely recommend to older folks, less tech savvy friends, or ""hype beasts"" since you cannot compete with how easy everything works with Apple's ecosystem. And their update support is just unmatched, but man I personally can never go back to the iPhone Every thing Marques said about Android being the reason he prefers that OS applies to me as well. I will push it a bit further than him though and mention APKs, you could add apps that normally both companies don't have on their stores that are honestly games changers."

In some places the iPhone is somewhat of status symbol…. Then many would want their phone to retain their value when they upgrade, the iPhone is the best phone to resell because their value does hold unlike many android phones. Peace out 👏"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I had android before and my latest one (Samsung Galaxy note) was just so hard for me to navigate. I moved to iPhone 11 from that Samsung and I have no regrets, easy to use, felt great in my hand, just the phone for me. Now I've upgraded and I'm still happy. It is very personal and I wouldn't dare say iPhone is the best, it's just the best for me. The ecosystem is another thing, I have both MacBook Air and Apple Watch and it's very handy for me how these devices work together.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,It's getting to a point now where apple just feels like its releasing the same phone... plus everything is so expensive for them where I'm starting to think I will switch to a samsung for my next phone. I've had an 11pro for 4 years now but these new iphones feel like such a scam.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I used android my whole life and switched to iPhone 13pro because I value ease of use and don’t care for all the customizations and such. All I have to say is there are glaring issues with iPhone that drive me insane. The keyboard swipe texting and autocorrect are absolutely garbage. The fact I HAVE to have a lockscreen password when I have apply pay, which I have to unlock with a passcode anyways even if the phone is already unlocked, is absolutely dumb. The notification system is horrible. There are multiple straight up bugs in the Lock Screen that are super repeatable. For example. Type in wrong password? It auto deletes 3 of the numbers imputed but not the first, so when you go to type in your password (1,2,3,4) you type (1,1,2,3) and you got it wrong again. So while also at a lockscreen that should just have a fingerprint scanner, and one I didn’t want to be locked anyways, I am now battling with a bugged pin style password screen that is making me want to throw my phone at the wall. Your phone is locked and you want to change what Bluetooth device your phone is connected to? Okay swipe down hood the Bluetooth logo to enter the device list, wrong, type in your password, okay I type it in so now it willl open the device list, wrong it turns off Bluetooth. It does this every time you follow that pattern from the lockscreen. such easy ease of use issues just are not tackled on iPhone. Notifications are garbage, bluetooth I find is a disaster and not just for this aforementioned issue, autocorrect and swipe texting are bad. Also did I mention that my onePlus 6T had better, faster and more reliable face recognition than my 13 pro? And it also had a fingerprint scanner? iPhone needs to just take care of some basic shit because I’m debating going back to android after one modern iPhone. Such easy issues completely ignored."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Personally, I prefer Android for a very strong point, which is being able to divide the screen and use several applications simultaneously, without having to exit the application or have an extra screen."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I loved android customization back in the days, but now i think iPhone is perfect, Camera and software is absolute best, things like airdrop and now the namedrop are some features i cant live without, also switching phones is so much easy, I still remember a year back i had to switch my iphone because it was broken by accident, and literal took me half hour to switch to new iPhone without any issues, all my settings, data and everything was in my new phone, that would’ve been a challenge on android, because each android phone comes with different settings and stuff from the specific model and companu"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I had been an iPhone fanboy till 2020 when I got the taste of Android and switched sides. I just loved the way Android lets you customise your phone the way YOU want it and that for me was the biggest reason for the switch and I've been happy ever since!!
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"well for me i use android its the best for me apple I just dont like its has limited features and also many apps are made for android so i will always choose android it is easy for me , well it might differ from person to person bcuz of the way they use and for what they use but  i gotta be hones android vs apple android will always win just think about pixel easy to use and many advantages."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"One thing not discussed is one of the things you rely on most often, and that is unlocking your phone.  As both an iPhone (13) and Android (S23) user, the iPhone wins hands down.  The Galaxy's face unlock is horrible, as is the under screen fingerprint sensor.  Ultimately I wasn't able to use a glass screen protector with my S23 and yes, that as even after increasing touch sensitivity and taking multiple fingerprint scans.  iPhone's face ID works seamlessly in all light conditions, and for that reason alone I would choose an iPhone as my daily driver."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"iPhone is better only in ""Updates and support if you ask me, because I use a samsung device.

1. I can't give ""ease of use"" to a phone with no dedicated back button or gesture. There are a lot of features that are easier to access or use in iPhones, but this goes to Android for many other features too. For me and most of the people ""ease of use"" is the ability to use my device however I want. iPhone only allows users to use the device as THEY want. Just having a better auto camera is not enough to justify ""ease of use"". Can iPhones open up a pop up/split view calculator when I need it? Does iPhones have a convenient side edge panel to access whatever app, settings, tool that I want when I'm doing something in my phone? iPhone doesn't even have half the number of widgets compared to Android. Doesn't that come under ease of use? Doesn't AOD come under ease of use? 
120Hz scrolling...a universal cable...fast charging...All these come under ease of use and even a $200 Android phone gives these basic features. iPhone doesn't for it's base varients, even though they are more expensive.

2. Apps. Apps may me more optimised in iPhones. But atleast Android gives me the freedom to use whichever app I want. I don't have to polish neither apple's nor Google's shoes to use my apps. I mean even if you are saying that these are secured by iPhone and Google, the truth is that both these companies are monitoring every bit of your usage. Another thing is that Samsung is stepping up their app optimisation. Just open Instagram in an iPad and Samsung tab side by side and you'll understand which one is better optimised.

Ultimately, these two features are based on how you see ""Ease of use"" and ""Apps"". The apple fans think of these two things within apple's bubble. For them ease of use is default actions and all. But for Android users ease of use is the ability to use the full potential of the device that they bought with their hard earned money and customising it to suit THEIR ease of use. Because everyone has different ways to get things done. Android allows this flexibility, while whatever features you get in apple in the for of ""ease of use"" is constrained to apple's rules. They decide. You just follow...

P.S. I live in India. So imessages, apple pay and facetime are not at all popular..."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"You know this is bull crap, all phones should be supported indefinitely, what is this ridiculous crap with 3 years support or 5 years support. We are all scammed by these companies, they make these devices to break, to be hard to repair, a damn battery replacement is hard to do these days. They cut updates and worse security updates because they are manipulating us into buying more devices. This is abusive capitalism. What's worse is that the devices aren't even much better. I should be able to use my phone 20 years from now if I want to, but I can't cause I would basically be risking my freaking life if someone hacks me and empties my accounts and why? Cause freaking x or y company don't want to update my device even if it can be updated. Sorry but the real video isn't about Iphone vs Android, it's about which of them is penetrating us more."

I had to be honest with myself and was not customizing things as much as I used to given the nature of my career. Then add in the fact that working in the technological industries most people use Iphone. Air Drop has been a life saver for my photography gigs and over all it just works. Had some really bad luck on the android side where I had to download third party apps to even use basic features such as camera, phone and texting to be able to get in touch with clients. It was time to upgrade and just made the swap. I love that you also do not make this list as a definite winner for everyone."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Good job. But I would not really agree with ""Apps"" category
First of all:
From my point of view as a developer it's much more easier to release upgrade on the android. Verification goes faster. Yeah, prioritization still depends on company choise, but bank app I use aleays releases new features on the andriod first. They develop both in parallel but android always passes verification faster.
Secondly: on the android you can install apps outside of the official play market. It can benefit if your app, for example, is removed from ofiicial store (hello Russians). Its again about choise and freedom.
For example, you can download telegram from their official website and get updates immediately, before play market or app store.
That's why i would give ""App"" point to the android.
P.S. from developer perspective andriod gives you freedom how to make your app, while apple like always tells you how to do it ""correctly"". That's also why their verification takes more time."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I just switched to iPhone from exclusively android and specifically pixel. The biggest thing that I miss so far is the lack of universal back gesture swipe from either side of the phone like on my pixel. Other than that, everything else has been pretty minor."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I know without watching that the Apple has long expired.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Ease of use and updates aren't nearly as important as features, customization and variety/choice. They are afterthoughts.

The biggest reason for me was the availability of repair parts, before that I had a Samsung Galaxy S10 I think it was, but when the screen broke, it would have cost me almost as much as a new phone, so I looked at the replacements for apple (non original of course) and decided that that’s worth it.

But who knows, maybe my next phone will be a Fairphone 🤷🏼"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I think the real question should be iOS vs Android

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I honestly do not care about the iphone vs android war. But i do think Android is better bc so many android phones bave amazing features that iphone doesnt have or will finally get 3 or 4 years after android. I mean they still cant even change their text message colors. Thats kinda basic. I remember when my iphone friends were all excited about having widgets and i was like ive had those for so long now. Iphone is great for many things sure. But i do like my samsung products better.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,One  category you should've added was SECURITY. I know that Apple updates their phones continuously if there's a security threat. Take for instance what just happened with iOS 17. We are now on 17.0.1.   I feel very  when I use my Apple 14 iPhone. I don't know about android.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Ecosystem is the sole reason I buy Apple products. Got a Macbook for work years ago and just slowly shifted everything over the ability to just take notes or do work on my laptop and keep my stuff synced is too nice.

It also fails to consider basic functionalities like FILE SHARING, which is a hassle in iOS, not to mention attempting to use the smartphone for file storage through a USB cable.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"As an app developer for both Android and iOS. The ""iOS comes first before android because of less difference in device specs"", is no more. It definitely was in the iOS 4 days. You had 4 screen sizes vs 60.000+ for android and the percentage of people that wanted to pay for your app on iOS was way higher, so yhea easy choice. Then for features in the app we still have that many apps are written twice in their native language to give that native iOS feeling, but this becomes less every year because writing your app once for multiple platforms is just cheaper and more efficient from a company point of view and more platforms like React and Flutter provide this for you. The real feature differences you will find are the UX rules that Apple and Android will dictate and some hardware differences that the latest iPhone has vs the latest Android."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I will have to disagree with you on the ease of use.
Android should take that. And it should be a landslide too.
Let me tell you why.
I'm a pro user. Heavy user, High end user, whatever you wanna call it.
I use no less than around 90 different apps with my daily driver phone.
Most of those are banking, smart home apps (from my smart devices and home electronics), etc.
Now ONE other app is DROPBOX.

Please try to read an email, where you get an official invoice or pdf document that's very important and you wanna save that to your dropbox directly, in a specific folder in your Dropbox, where you have hundreds of thousands of files, organized each by their own folders, etc...
Please tell me: how many taps does it take (IF you CAN make it) on the iPhone, and how many on ANY android phone (yes, also talking about the entry level $100 devices as well!

Also, there is an app for one of my mobile phone providers (I use 2 of those at the same time IN the same device, with physical SIM cards (let that sink in) Vodafone, Orange, etc...),  and that app will show me my invoice, as a PDF being embedeed into a nice iFRAME in a webview app.

That's a very respectable company app. Right? They have the exactl same webview loading on both iPhone and Android.
Android KNOWS that's a pdf document and GIVES me the option to SAVE that file to my FILESYSTEM (let FILESYSTEM SINK IN A BIT TOO). 
iPhone, just displays a VERY crappy resolution pdf document in a very crappy little window WITH NO options whatsoever. 
DO YOU KNOW how annoying that is?
DO YOU KNOW which one is EASIER FOR ME, to use?

Don't think you that in 41 years of LIFE, I would KNOW how to place a phone call icon on my smartphone screen?

If you're giving that to the iPhone, you're probably doing it to match the mentally challenged people and NOT the REAL SMART, phone, users...

Love your stuff though by the way. Just very aggravated about this one thing here :))

Oh, and please share multiple photos combined with some documents from your downloads folder in your..... FILESYSTEM... in an iPhone :))))) ANY iPHONE :)) just how..... EASY, is that? Do it while in an WhatsApp conversation without exiting that conversation screen.... 

It's just... SAD man! It's SAD!"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I think Samsung is really close to launching their own version of imacs after seeing their M8 monitor and Galaxy book laptops.  It will be super interesting to get those.  Have never heard anyone on youtube discuss this.

Yeah ease of use, as long as you don't care about what you want and deal with what Apple ""allows"" you to do.   IOS I find the store reviews are way higher on the same apps ...because it doesn't allow some reviews. The apps also suck OR cost FAR more OR don't even exist. Also hate the way Apple bills.  APPS WAY Better in android.  If you are not into a cult mentality Android. Iphone just wants to do things different so people CAN'T do what they want.   Facetime = You can do video with people on a ton of apps.  WHY Apple ecosystem sucks is you have to use their stuff only.  The ""pill"" on my phone has a great use,,,cover the top of apps you are displaying.  This one cracks me up, their lame lightning charging...then I get a a good magsafe and apple watch charger...plug goes in is a c-plug lol so If I want to use just the cord instead of the whole charging unit I can't.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Great video!  I would have rated a tie on Apps between iPhone and Android.  The way I put it --  is can you think of any app that is on iPhone that is not on Android (or if there is -- is there an app equivalent? -- I would say Yes -- there is an equivalent -- and you're not missing anything on either platform).  The two OSes are just such big big markets for apps there are no app holes in either ecosystem. It really is IMO a tie.

I agree with Marques on his ecosystem comment.  Although,  I'd almost say tie. Like Marques said the flexibility of the ecosystem goes to Android (and Samsung had an answer for almost everything in Apples ecosystem to include AirDrop) -- and I would say a slight ease of use advantage goes to Apple. So depends on how you think of the ecosystem and what you care about, on who you'd give the win on this one.

Really like the point of this video it really comes down to personal choice.  My big reason for loving Android is because of all the hardware choices and options you get with Android.  I love choice.

Lastly -- Marques made the comments that these were ""objective"" categories -- most of them are not objective categories -- they are subjective based on opinion.  I think the only almost objective category was support, because you can measure that in years -- but then also remember that iPhones almost always get F grades in ""repairability"", so even that one is not that clear. ;-) 

Again -- great video -- I like the balanced view. They really are both great mature mobile operating systems."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Just got an iPhone as a work phone and the inability to just place an icon where i want it on the screen is mildly infuriating.

I’m also just not an apple person I don’t like their computers don’t like their OS. I’ve always been on windows so that’s probably part of it.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Why people love IPhone? Because iPhone control them by inability to take responsibility in their life.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Basically, the iPhone is made for old people or people who don't like change. This also means that these people just continue to buy iPhones just because. They just want a phone that does its job.

The Android is for people who like customisation and/or control. They want their phone to work the way they want it to. They like having lights flash and colours glow when they get a message. They like things a certain way.

I arrive at this conclusion from expirence. Having started with Android going to iPhone for years for better battery and faster processing but then going back to Android because of continuous icloud password requests, mail sync issues and bugs like song double ups and iTunes not realising you already have a song downloaded, syncing to your next upgraded iPhone.

The iPhone was easy to use, but it's problems persist through upgrades. You find yourself getting an iPhone so it just works but then going to android because the iPhone annoys you. It's a vicious circle."

I could not care about most of these points because I'm stuck on: Why does my bluetooth turn on again automatically?, Why did my iPhone highjacked my headphone in the middel of a meeting?
I felt like an old-fart who has no idea how to use a new piece of tehc altough it was just a stupid ass company phone.

BTW I had to lisen to people that iPohnes are the most beutiful artpice in the world. Then I got one and it has ugly, very colorful but unharmonized look.

To me the user expirience was just so painful that I don't care about Apple and it's products."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The bit about the apps is actually the other way around - Android is king when it comes to apps - both quantity and quality - you have the Playstore, third-party app stores and the entire internet 😂😂😂😂 let's not forget about ease of app installation - we are still waiting for official sideloading from Apple 😏😏😏😏"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"While Android is obviously the better system, it's true that what makes for the best phone choice is very subjective and personal.

Hopefully, though, people will put some thought into what they choose."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The answer is family ...
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"This video so biased towards iOS, I have used both iPhone 14 pro Max and currently using pixel 7, pixel 7 fars way better on multiple fronts than iPhone 14 pm, ui experience is better on pixel phones than iPhone, app usage is laggy on iPhone, hate the app ui on iPhone, very very difficult to use apps on iPhone, the only plus point of ios over Android is video camera.
1) customization is way better on Android
2) features are better on Android
3) ease of use is again better on Android than on iOS, if it's customizable then it's easier to use that's the whole point of ""customisation"", idk how this dude gave 3rd point to ios 😂
4) updates depend upon the company, premium phones offer 4/5 yrs.
5) apps is a huge let down for iPhones. The cost behind the in app purchases in ios is more then Android. For ex on androjd YouTube monthly premium costs 129 rs while on iOS it costs 179 rs. App experience isnt that great on iOS either. WhatsApp ui sucks big time, same goes with iMessage. The ui has been stagnant for ages on iOS, used 2 iphones iPhone 14pm and iphone 10, can't go back to ios now, there is absolutely nothing new on iOS. Apps lag on iOS too, it's not like ios is better than Android on this front. 
Another example is using credit cards on Google pay app, on Android you can pay via credit cards from Google pay app but not on iPhone. You can't even add credit cards on Google pay app, the feature is disabled. Costly In app purchases plus stupid app ui and lack of extra features on UPI apps makes iPhone less interesting. 
6) I am not sure I bought any smartphone out of excitement
7) ecosystem ? May be in us and Canada not in eastern hemisphere. Android and windows anytime better than sturdy ui of ios. 

There is only one advantages of ios -"" video cam stabilization"". That's it! It is leaps ahead of Android.
Pixel 7 is my go to smartphone now. Will buy pixel 8 pro just for the camera. The images are stunning and natural than the brighter pics on iPhone(which I hate). 
I thought of going for iPhone every 2 yrs but later checked the pixel 7 pro with my friend and shifted to pixel 7 this march, this device is amazing. Why should I pay 1.4L when I can get all the things and some more things in around 50k? 
There is one device which I definitely recommend in ios - iPad!"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Great video, I'm using an android since I stopped using iphone 4s, but I love macbook and iPad. One amazing thing on a samsung phone fo example -> fingerprint sensor below the screen !"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Being able to install any APK I want is the only thing making me stick to android. If not for that I may have switched this year.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Why would Android ecosystem be limited to just Samsungs? And not the fact that Android's open source nature allows for a significantly larger variety.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,For me it’s Apple 😊
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Lol most useless points went for iPhone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i could never use an iphone cause i love customization and headphone jacks
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android win
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I worked at a particular company I won’t say because I technically can’t. However they definitely don’t want the users to make their phones look trashy. I’ll be honest…I agree with them. I see so many of the other companies phones where the users (so yes it’s not that company’s fault) have just made that companies phone look sh*t…and that phone ultimately is an advert for the brand. Sounds harsh, not that I care, but the average user can’t be trusted to not screw up their phone. Every technician knows what I mean…the general public are terrible at using technology, and if they have an option which they can mess up….they will. They’re the same people who have CCleaner and 21 other ‘cleaning’ applications installed…all of which are running the non paid versions and it’s atrocious lol"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,A huge category which you didn't even mention is the pricetag. I will never ever be willing to pay triple the price for something that has the same value as the cheaper product.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The definitive answer is this. If you live in the US and need imessage, get the iPhone.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Personally, I don't entirely agree with the apps category take. I think it depends on the apps you use. I use Gmail, Google Maps and YouTube a lot and those apps work great on my Pixel. Which I assume is because they are Google apps. But I don't use Instagram much and I know that is better on iOS."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The problem is, that all the Android Flagships are so big size Phones (bigger than 6,1 Zoll) - that’s actual the mean reason why I stay at apple 🍎. I had a pixel 5 this size/wight was great!"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Only reason I have an iPhone is FaceID. My fingers just don’t work with fingerprint readers and I get so irrationally angry when it doesn’t work lol.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android should be the winner in apps category imo. You can literally get any paid/subscription based apps for free
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The personal categories is real. I’m all in on Apple and I genuinely enjoy using their products. I really do not care about customization so my android friends rave about that but it has absolutely no draw for me.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,That's actually a very good system to determine what's the winner.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I like structure. That’s why I have a iPhone 😌
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Apple still fckin cant add the most important and basic features to ios… when you go to the keypad and tap some numbers, a sugestion of some contact will appear."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Eas of use ios? That's a joke. I can take any camera, TV, music player, any electronic device and k know where to look for any setting. Any device but apple one. First device I had to Google where to turn on something, some turn out to be unavailable.
Updates? Another joke. I have updates for years for ios, but every next update makes the device slower and provides less things than for current sold device, plus those new things are available on other systems for years.
Apps. I got far less apps for ios. Total number might be greater but I want local app, or some good weather app and it's not available for ios.
I'm not watching any longer, this video is a joke"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I think the difference now is becoming very small,  I’ve constantly switched from android to iPhone for years and they both do what I need them to do, I happen to prefer iPhone at the moment, it’s the little details that win me over."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I had Android for years! Mainly a Samsung Galaxy S9+. It was a good phone. I recently bought an iPhone14 plus and regret it. Now I'm waiting to get to the minimum payment of the iPhone so that I can trade that in for an Android phone.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I won’t assign the same value to the categories. The debate continues for me😂
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"regarding the customization features found in android. I'd really be interested to see how much of the overall public actually take advantage of how deep android can be customized. Most people around me just want a great phone with great basic features. Sure, there will be the people that customize every aspect of a phone. But I'd wager most don't touch the extra features."

*Also ease of use? If ease of use means the mobile not having anything, then easiest decision is to have a cheap Android which doesnsame thing for 4 times lower price than apple phones , simply dont use a flagship phone as a basic mobile accessory and know that buying a 1000$ phone because its simple because it lacks things is stupid*"

As someone who worked as a computer tech for a while, I had a gut feeling Ease of Use would go straight to iPhone, because that concept was something I found annoying and limiting, inverse relationship with that and customization as you said.

Haven't finished video yet, but I love the direction of this video, pointing out people will have different or subjective preferences or uses for their devices."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I have an iPhone just because of viruses: if android’s phones were just as safe as iPhones I’d just go with android honestly.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Great video but with the ease of use I don’t really get; you take the arrangement of apps on a phone for a long time over the freedom of using bluetooth to send and receive files, pictures and apps or being able to download music and apps online without payments.

This, like many other tons of other reviews over the internet are just a facad, it's one of those videos where the author gives his/her impression and strong bias opinion over Apple products and using such terms as less quantity over quality to upsell apple products and it's not surprisingly that in such reviews apple products and to be concise Iphones in particular ends up to be the winner. It's laughable indeed to see @Marques on 16:03 scoring high on apple's IPhone and opines that he uses Android phone as his main and cites that apple's ecosystem scores high over other products.It's insane to come and think of it. Every manufacturers have their own ecosystem and it varies hugely but to use this as a yardstick of measurement is arguably silly and laughable...and to top it all, Apple Devotees are paying up premium over features that are decade old in other platforms. Any Android phone with the price range of $299 or less , comes with USB-C port,fast charging, 8gb RAM, 50mp camera and a 128gb Rom  as base model, something you can never find in the Apple ecosystem at this price points!!!! @Marques, it's laughable and silly to justify your claims and contrast that Iphone is better than an Android  especially when the products base model comes at $899. How about you factor in affordability when doing such reviews?"

Perhaps it's because I'm getting old but they're definately important considerations for me. Based just on the differences in the business models - Android is produced by a company who's business model is to give most stuff away for free but collect and monetize as much personal information as they possibly can, whereas iOS is produced a product company that makes their money by charging (quite a lot) for products and doesn't make money from advertising, Apple should completely own privacy but it would be interesting to hear your view."

You sad android is more exciting because there is more going on, and its true that there is more going on on android side, but that doesn't apply to android users because they don't get any new features on their phones, its only once in couple of years when you get new android phone that you get some new features and later on its the same phone with nothing new coming to him and that is boring. But on the iphone on the other hand its much more exciting because you get new features with every new version of ios, and you get the feel every time like you just got new phone all together, so it newer gets boring. And you always wander what new features will come next time.. 
Also on android phone people don't even know what hidden features they have because they keep changing with every new phone, but on iphone people know about its features and are using them, because you continue to use ios with every new iphone you upgrade to, and so you get to know it much better and deeper over the years.. 
Android is the best thing that happened since smartphones came to be, because its basically freedom, unlike apples ios is,
but if we want to improve it we need to know what is not so good about it.."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,It'd be hilarious if you did this for tablets. Android can't even compete lol

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Thats the only reason samsung is big bc the places where they sell more is where people dont have the services for the iphone like we do in the US
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Loved that db cover on your phone ❤❤❤
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I like both but prefer Android. USA mostly is super brainwashed that if it is not an iPhone it is not good.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Apps better on ios?? 😂 whenever I wanted to install an app on an iphone I couldn't, there are so much more apps available for Android"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The best Android over iPhone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Android is available on numerous smartphone brands, whereas iOS is exclusive to iPhones. Therefore, comparing an operating system like Android, which is accessible on a variety of smartphone brands, with iOS, which is limited to Apple's iPhones, may not be a fair comparison. It's akin to comparing open source software with closed source software."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,isn't it should be iOS vs Android ?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I believe the real winner is the side that has a larger demographic of people owning the product android is still ahead on that demographic so until apple decides to make cheaper phones the android side will still be larger
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"As a hoppy app developer who just makes apps to make life easier, the android wins for me. I can create apps and share them with friends and family easily, free of charge. On iOS you will need a developer license (which is not free), you need a Mac to even deploy the app, and the phones you want to deploy to needs to be registered as developer phones."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Excitement would go to iPhone too since features aren’t exciting until they get on iPhones lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I once bought an android phone that required to download the phone app before you make a call. No.Definitely
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Worst thing about the new iPhones is they absolutely suck for cell service. My iPhone 11 was awesome. My 13 pro is terrible. I live in a rural area and service is always a problem but this is terrible. I even took it back and got a new SIM card put in. I warned a family member not to get a 13 pro but he did and he’s regretting it. It just will not stay connected to lte. Switches to 3G all the time and then I can’t use it
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iPhones stay the same with minor updates or upgrades once a year. iOS 17 isn’t all that can’t change the fonts still. 😂
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I think apple is the ""Social"" choice. In college I was the only person with an Android phone in my whole class. That was way more isolating than you'd expect. Folks would facetime eachother and play iMessage games and that was just how they communicated. This was exacerbated by Covid but still. I'm still Android though for now at least. Since college and since Pixels have taken off, I've seen far more Androids out and about"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,damn the music

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Dude, I am using Android 13 on a 10 year old phone. You can't restrict the update-ability to only official updates."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I couldn’t make the choice, so I use a Galaxy S23 and an iPhone 14."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"There are problems with this comparison as per it's current title. The first of which is if comparing OS's the title should be iOS vs Android as iPhone isn't an OS it's a device name. Then if just comparing the OS's then Ecosystem is an invalid comparison as an Ecosystem has nothing to do with the OS, it's entirely a company thing, as demonstrated by the fact that Samsung also has an ecosystem now. The fact is that while it's true that iOS IS Apple and vice versa, that conflation needs to be separated in any fair and honest comparison, i.e you EITHER do a Apple vs Samsung comparison (where Ecosystem as a comparison becomes valid) or you do an iOS vs Android comparison (where Ecosystem isn't a valid comparitor). 
I'm also not convinced by the continuity argument with respect to ease of use, as continuity is just that and has nothing to do with ease of use. An OS could have a rigid inflexible and horrendously difficult to use UI and be unchanging across 20 major OS updates and thus have continuity but have very poor ease of use. So the fact that iOS has remained essentially an unchanged UI over generations is NOT an ease of use plus point, it's a UI continuity plus point nothing more. On the flip side, the configurablity of an OS is not a negative for ease of use, an OS can be very configurable and still remain simple to use. If it's natively got a simple UI then the fact that it can be configured to have an horrendous UI does not negate that in ""stock/native"" form it's an easy to use UI. Given that both iOS and Android use icon based UI's with a multitude of pages and apps, then they are inherently identical when it comes to ""ease of use"". In fact you can justifiably argue that an OS with an infinitely configurable UI can be easy to use by everyone, as it could theoretically be configured to suit every individuals needs with respect to ""ease of use"". Anyway ease of use always comes down to familiarity, there simply is no such thing as ""objectively easier to use"" when it comes to comparing two OS with similar levels of complexity (of course a feature lean, low functionality OS/UI will have an inherent advantage with ease of use as there's simply less ways to use it). Apple product users will always argue that Windows is less intuitive and harder to use than Apples OS, but Windows users will say the same about Apples OS. The very fact that Windows (or Android) users do not wholesale agree that Apples OS's are easier to use is all the proof needed to completely negate the Apple OS is easier to use argument. If it were, EVERYONE would agree it to be the case."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I owned both android and iphone since 10 years ago. 10 years ago, I barely touch android because its lags, lack of ease of use. But now, most of the time my hand tends to hold android. Even if it doesnt get any update anymore, stuck at android 12, but the features, ease of use, customization, multitask, it really smooth and run along with my needs."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android is better. Dislike unfollow XD
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I had twice an Android phone and often minor issues. Then I switched to Iphone and everything is working for the last 8 years. I do not know how to explain but with Iphone I feel you get an harmonic system and support. And it was 100% reliable so far and I trust Apple with data security more than other providers. These points are all that matter to me and that‘s why I stick to Apple

Also I think when you make such video's, don't concentrate on the American market. The usa is a small portion of the world. 

Even the flagship Android cannot be a Google pixel. Are you paid by Google 🤔.

I’m naturally inclined to hyperfocus & fixate on every possible customization thing I can, so honestly, it got to be stressful on Android. The simplicity of iOS has been the most relaxing way to interact with a device, personally. (Then I pieced together the ecosystem & I haven’t needed to leave it. 🤷🏻)"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,3 million apps to 1 million Apps and it goes to iPhone? Lmao 😂
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Let's agree Android wins 🎉
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android upsets so much with their updates and I was a diehard android user but I switched and I switched because Apple doesn’t promise shit and don’t hold up their side of the bargain and you know where apple is going with their updates whereas androids updates don’t change shit.  Therefore I will remain team apple.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Great video but I would have mentioned android apps like One Hand Operation+, quick cursor, micro gesture. Apps that completely change how you use your phone. 

Not mentioning New Pipe, torrents and modded apps for reasons."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I know that with modern smartphones it's probably not much of an issue anymore, but I would have definitely been in the Android camp as a teen/young adult. I was all about customization and fiddling with shit, but as I got into my early twenties, I started getting sick of redoing all of my customizations every time I needed to reformat and reinstall my computer, or installed a new OS and struggled to get things back to the way they were.

I also used to use a fully custom key configuration when playing games, but constant reinstalls and constant reconfiguration made me sick of doing it all. So I basically just said ""screw it"" to all of that and just started using standard configurations. Standard, OOtB Windows with no fancy crap, WASD controls (which thankfully became standard), standard everything, which is why I really value the simplicity of iOS. 

Sure, sometimes I look at Android things and say ""that's pretty cool,"" but then I flash back to the olden days of fiddling with things for hours to get it _just right_ and I realize why iOS is right for me."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I used to be on the android side but switched to Apple a few years ago and now feel like I’m too deep in the ecosystem to ever go back 😭 what with an IPad Pro, MacBook Pro, AirPods, Airtags, how could I ever go back Android even if I wanted too 😭"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"For me, price of new phone and costs involved in repair and upgrade is an important category."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Sellout
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Amazing video....
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Never ever will I buy an iPhone. I can't support a company that takes away ports on their computers only to sell it back to them. They then do the same with the power bricks on their phones
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Apple customer service sucks.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I don't like apple anyhow, but on the homescreen I don't like that I can't put my apps where I want them to be."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The iPhone is definitely for people who barely use their phone.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,As an iPhone user what I miss about android is the ability to do…… whatever the hell I wanted but there’s just something about iPhone😂
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"both sucks, i wish phones were as open as desktop computers."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The both have pros and cons. It's all just what is important to you.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Ease of use I'd have to give Android only because the way you have to close out app tabs and even just close out an app is so excessive and unnecessary. Android makes it simple you choose the Apple style or you can have 'buttons' at the bottom of the screen which is leagues easier than relearning the Apple way
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Loved this!
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Gotta disagree on the apps part, mainly because APK files exist and are super easy for Android and are not possible for ios."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Marques, I believe you failed to mentioned 4 very important things for iPhone users:

- 3D face ID or 'the notch' for the non believers. :)
 The ability to unlock the phone seamlessly, with higher security than fingerprint that works even in the dark. The system even learns to recognize the changes we make along like growing beard, special makeup, etc.

- The vast processing power
 It allows us, or at least myself, to use the same iPhone for 4 years or more (always updated) without feeling it slow, without feeling any need to replace it, other than the desire to get a ""new toy"" (which I resist, because these things are expensive!). Many Android friends say iPhones are too expensive, but they spend more money on their Android devices over extended periods of time than me.

- The superior OS optimization.
  On iOS we can have literally dozens of apps opened in the background because we don't feel any weight or performance degradation from them.
Just for the purpose of this example, I've just counted how many I had at the moment and counted 45 opened apps. iOS memory management is way more advanced.
 Contrary to Android, iOS is almost maintenance free. Do I need all these apps opened? Of course not. But because they don't affect the performance, I simply forget to close them.
 Also, I rarely cold boot an iOS device to fix any issue because they're almost non existent. Maybe once or twice a year. Can you say the same of any Android smartphone?

- Very good battery life, also because of the iOS better optimization for its hardware. All iPhones (except for the SE of course), have good battery life. That's also why fast charging is not such a big deal in the iPhone world. Speaking for myself, I left home in the morning at 100%. It's past midnight at the time of this posting and it still shows 57% battery remaining in my one year old iPhone and my most used App is usually Youtube."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I think for ease of use, the real winner is whatever their ""tech support"" is familiar with. And by ""tech support"" I do not mean the company's employees, I mean whoever their goto tech person is in their social circle. I use Android, my grandmother also uses an Android, she regularly asks me how to do things on her phone, but if she had an iPhone, she'd likely still have to ask me, the main difference is then I'd have to learn the answer before I could show her due to not using an iPhone myself and not being nearly as familiar with it."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I personally am a Apple user and will stay as an Apple user for the foreseeable future. For me it’s really the ecosystem that makes me love apple.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Actually both of them are great, I have mix of both ecosystems and I’ve never chosen one because of the brand name… I find iOS better at simplicity, fluidity and look, while I find android better at productivity. If you want to be productive using iOS just switch to Mac OS… Android is so good regarding its file management and that you can open multiple windows at once, while ejecting a hard drive from iOS or iPadOS could damage it… I still find my galaxy better than my ipad regarding support for external devices, DeX feature which I wish that apple implements a similar feature on its iPadOS at least… On the other hand I wish that android would get better app quality sometimes. I would also suggest android to add simple mode for users who want simple user experience."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"You did not add the most important thing to the list:

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"For me, Apple has removed the joy.

I use Apple for work and Sony Android for home. The Apple is great for updates and it just slick.  The Android is more fun and interesting. I feel like I don't own the Apple (its a work phone so I don't really) because it is so limited in customisation and personalisation. But then I have had a Samsung in the past and it is so full of bloatware I cannot delete. My preference is Android. I really don't like the lockdown of Apple and I don't like the menu structure. The Apple screen is really nice and battery life is excellent."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,How about software security and battery performance?

More options can clutter the screen or they can be hidden neatly for the few who wants them. So if you need to change something about how you USE your phone, you can. But if you want to use your iPhone in a way that better suits you, you are fucked. Just because something doesn’t have options doesn’t mean it’s easier to use and there are soo many quality of life things iOS is missing.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I've had every android flagship for a decade. And one Iphone 13 pro max. I currently have an S23U and I CANT WAIT to get my hands on a 15 pro max and put this clunky curved edge bullshit out. Iphones just work. So much more polished. Face unlock, so fast. Making transactions with my face. super fast. Finger print scanner under the screen? Complete BS. Put it on the side where I can feel it. Pull it out of my pocket and its at the home screen ready to go even in the dark. My S23U is horrible with face unlock. Blah blah"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Idk as a current iPhone 14 pro max user I really am envious of Samsungs dex mode and periscope camera
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"No, hide my email is completely free. You don't even need a phone/iphone"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use 🪣
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Also, iwatch is shit for all the people who want a watch in circular form factor.....i would anyday go for garmin or any other giving me a circular one...moreover...mac...haha...a laptop that cant show iphone files on it over wire...man...I am trying to get over the apple ecosystem as soon possible....only ipad is something keeping me.there..."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Again on point 5, many do prioritize for Android too...and with half the app not available on iOS...i dont think ios stand a chance."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"On third point, i dont agree, if i can customize for my ease..the phone which is more customizable should be the one who wins..its clearly Android for 3rd point from my pov."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Already 2.7K reactions so you will probably won’t read mine.
However I don’t think that you don’t take into account the Apple ecosystem when you have a family. What’s up with that?"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Simple…iPhone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Perfect video along with that ""what categories companies are implementing in their phones"" long time ago, soooo helpful for tech enthusiast"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"You want latest features and gadgets? Samsung. You want a smartphone with only time tested and good features, with good specs and no hassle? Iphone"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I had Android for a few years.   Back to iPhone and could not be happier
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,9:10 what's the point of a hardware that can't handle the newer OS updates!! + don't forget that apple admit it's slowing down the older ones. So I guess it's tie if not lose
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android wins hands down for freedom but Samsung kills it with DEX
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"From user’s perspective:
Customization - Android
Features - Android 
Apps - Apple ( Many fraud apps ain’t there on iphone and apps seem pleasant on iphones , no bloat ware on iphone)
Updates - Apple
Ease of use - Android (because it’s easier to kill all apps at once instead of swiping one at a time and the notifications and settings can be seen all together when you drag down in android instead of apple having it left & right of the notch)
Ecosystem- Apple as mentioned it is smooth and seamless experience"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Watching this on my Pixel which I use 80% of the time over my iPhone. I only use my iPhone when I'm charging my Pixel and for photo/videoshoots (since I use an older model of Pixel). The only downside of Pixel for me is, it's not readily available in my country but I'm planning to upgrade to a newer Pixel soon. I guess it all comes down to preference. But Pixel (Android) for me 🥳"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Interesting that for ecosystem you mentioned Samsung for android as a rival for Appple, but not the Google ecosystem in general (gmail, password managers, Android TV syncing with your account, logging in to other ecosystems with the google account, plus all the smart home accessories)"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Excitement Android? LOL
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Please do a review of Harmony OS.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I took a risk with my current phone and went with the Oppo Find X5 Pro. The convenience of the super fast charging alone is enough to put me off wanting to go back to/try the 3 main brands Samsung, Google or Apple. Camera is also great. Definitely interesting what matters to different people."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,of course typical political answer as usual lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,You just lost my respect ... Android has more when it comes to the features of Android and then the thing you're forgetting about is Android allows a multitude of different hardware phones and each hardware can do its also own thing so you're missing out completely You've voided your whole argument in my opinion this whole video after a minute and a half don't even matter to me because you missed the main parts of the first part
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Fun comparison: and very personal of course. For me support/security is very important, but I go with Android for the Ecosystem. Yes, Apple's Ecosystem is better integrated, but also very restrictive. If you put 'open' to third parties above 'integration' Android wins Ecosystems hands down. 
Another point I missed was 'costs'. When you go mid range, Apple can barely keep up, low range they are missing altogether. Yes, the Apple watch has the best sensors, but they are way too expensive. 
So here I am, with a 'cheap' phone, cheap smart watch and an incredibly cheap Chromebook. And yes, I need to replace my phone early, but hey, I've got the savings to spend and I can do all I want to do."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Imagine saying software updates are better on Iphone when you know with each update they make your device slower with the sole purpose of you having to buy the newer phone to have a better experience again. What a CULT apple users are.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Security and privacy not a category in 2023?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I agree that official updates support goes easily to Apple, but how about unofficial.. There are lot of community behind older android phones in form of custom roms. It is quite fragmented but it is there. There is no similar thing for Apple."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I miss a lot of important aspects, which makes Android much more attractive (and I want to buy an iPhone badly): 
1. Price-range (begins much cheaper), 
2. always on display, 
3. multi-screen/apps at the same time, 
4. faster charging, 
5. unlocking with face and finger, 
6. app drawer (keeps the home screens much cleaner), 
7. side bar, 
8. usage of other accessoires with phone (why can't I use a watch by choise with iPhone 😡)"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"iMessage is still a dealbreaker for me that keeps me on iOS. I’m shocked more people don’t see it that way. I’ve used android for extended periods of time, and although I enjoy playing with its customization, it falls short as a communication tool for me. Being the only person in my social circle with an Android makes it difficult for everyone else if I’m in a group chat with friends, or maybe a new group chat planning a specific event. My phone will always be a communication device before it’s ever a toy. And for me the iPhone still does that better."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Additional ecosystem things that should be compared too is privacy and security
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I mean...the most important aspect is actually missing. Price? Especially Price-Performance. You get way more bang for your buck on android. I can't see how the iphone that hasnt barely changed for 5 years can even compete. The new ""features"" are actually a joke. You get video/audio erasers, sharpeners, foldable phones, thermometers and what not on android phones and also every new innovative software features are on android first while the iphones look the same and dont come up with really new stuff for eternities. It's all good and solid plus easy to use and ecosystem is great but that's about it. The ridiculous price also says the same. It's about time for innovations."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,What does MKBHD stand for?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Leaving out security makes no sense to me, and influences me far more than the feature list you use. Which phone OS is more vulnerable to hacking. Get real Marques, how could leave security off the list? How about the rate of updates, the actual time it takes to get an update out? How about how long the phone stays viable? How long and at what rate the value and function lasts?  What is the resale value of the used phone? How many Android phone are junk in three years, lacking significant updates. You are comparing the top of the line Android devices. In general, if you include all Android devices they will compare much worse. Junk Android phones are unlimited. The plethora of junk apps on Android is the same."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Me: he’s spitting facts
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Common Apple W
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I like iPhone for privacy features, ease of use, updates, apple music, car play, CPU speed and apple wallet. I also like the excellent hardware quality. For myself and family, I've purchased 13 iPhones and none ever broke or had issues."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro what are you talking about with each of use not being the most important thing in your day to day. that's legit the most important thing
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"This issue is the same as lot of other issues in our life: EV vs ICE, PS vs PC, etc... there is no perfect one for everyone. Each person has a set of priorities, preferences and skills. I own both iphone and android phones (a latin america thing). Being that I am older, I tend to prefer iphone for most of my important things (work, automation, chats, etc). It just works. Every time. Without fail. 
I use the android for a secondary phone line, and have tried it as a backup for automation. It tends to fail more than the iphone. For most works it does fine, but there were instances where the phone just froze or could not figure it out what was wrong.
I have younger coworkers that swear by android. They love making their phone unique (customized lockscreen, etc), and I get it. I just don´t have the patience to figure out what went wrong when it goes wrong. I have to admit, having a phone mimic jarvis from iron man is cool. But I use the phone mostly for work. Would not give up consistency over coolness."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,A video to show how Marques have inside info on apple.. guess 10/10 the new stuff em? hahaha
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The answer is iPhone just saying 😊
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Updates 5
Ease of Use 5
Apps 4
Features 3
Customization 3
Excitement 2
Ecosystem 1

iPhone - 15
Android - 8

who's agreeing lol?
all my life i prefered Android over iPhone but recently i bought iPhone 13 Pro and not regret it (yes, there has been some minor issues cause i needed to relearn how to so some things but over time its ok)"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I get that reviewers can't really endorse this, but talking about android without mentioning sideloading and community mods doesn't really make sense. I could never switch to to iphone just because of this, I haven't seen a yt ad in years thanks to the modded version of youtube, paying nothing, I've upgraded my 200$ phone's camera  so much with the modded gcam at the point that people with iphones ask me to take photos. In general having access to GitHub creations allows you to do so much more. Sticking to intended features leaves so much on the table that it really doesn't make sense anymore as a comparison."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"At least in Australia, the iPhone still cannot connect to our public transport system to replace physical cards. I'm in Melbourne where we have Myki and haven't had a physical card in years. My partner has an iPhone and needs to carry a wallet just so she can use public transport. App/feature/hardware that means I won't be swapping for a long time"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Lol, @mkbhd just mentioned all the new features of the new iPhone 15 2 weeks prior…. xD 12:52"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"another thing have to face it absolutely it doesn’t make it bad, but android is a “cookie cutter” operating system that several different phone manufacturers use a lot like windows. Apple‘s phones and computers, etc. Apple makes the hardware and the software and there’s definitely something to be said for that."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"As always, the video is excellent, but I do have to say I’m pretty surprised that, especially these days security was not a factor in your evaluations between the two different systems"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Another great video and great way to compare the two without taking a completely biased side. Always enjoy your videos. Appreciate what you bring to the table and teach all of us with.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,How about rhe update from iOS makes your iphone slower?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Hey Marques, love the videos, I remember when I had an iPhone 3/4 (can’t recall) and I thought I’ll have a change and went for the Sony Experia Z way back, I think it was one of the first waterproof phones.. 🤷🏻‍♂️ I thought it was a nice phone, but I couldn’t get on with the OS at the time, so ended up buying an iPhone 4s halfway through my contract and I’ve had iPhones since. 
But I do like the look of some of the Samsung phones they are nice looking phones but I have preordered an iPhone 15 Pro.. 👌🏻"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I just want the android to support airdrop and have better video . I love everything else
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,What happened to MKBHD video design? What are all these crazy colors and fonts ? Did your designer die or something?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Shall I switch from android to iPhone... Will be  there any difficulty while handling?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"0:57: 📱 This video compares customization options between iPhone and Android.

Recap by Tammy AI"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Bro sent the 'Value for Money' category flying right out of the window didn't he :P
Does the viewer even know by watching this video how costly it is to own an iPhone for all the pros this video shows over an Android ?"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Remember when iphone ""updates"" deliberately slowed down earlier models?? That was just criminal."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Funny how it's iphone vs android. The one man army 🫡
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"But when it comes to updates, Apple wins over everything else Android.There are also more categories where Android wins. The most important point is, for example, manufacturer independence!"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I'm actually considering iPhone. Weird since i'm all for the open source stuff and repairability and everything. But. Well. What i want from my phone is for it to function as a phone. A good camera is a plus. So yea might as well dip my toes into the apple ecosystem while i'm at it. Aaaand that is why i'm binging phone reviews, need to find one that fits my bill. Not sure what i go for, but need to find out ""fast"", before that crack caused black spot spreads over large enough area that i can't use this phone anymore. Yep swapped the screen already, i'm surprised how easy it was and that xiaomi had an official guide on doing it. Ended up dropping a hammer on it the next day and the screen protector wasn't enough.
So yea, a good screen protector is also a must. I should probably invest a large amount of the phone budget on otterbox or similar. Supcase seems nice too."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"these reviews have become as stale as new phones stale in innovation, don't get me wrong, phones have come a long way but there's no excitement in the ohone spanlce anymore."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Why price is not a category when you can have 2 google pixels for the price of a single iPhone ?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Very surprising to see ""Ease of Use"" going to Apple, without even being mentioned that it can be extremely subjective based on the region. LIke in most part of Asia, Android is de facto and apple still remains an aspirational product. Now although the sales are growing that ever before, but I'd say ""Ease of Use"" can be derived from if someone who's never used a smart phone, which would they find easier to adapt to. And here, hands down it's Android. I've had my grandparents, and many elderly giving their iPhone up for much cheaper Android phone just for their ease of use and simplicity. Marques, I've been an avid follower for so long, this was unfortunate to see."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so basically The clear winner is Android ? Right??? Android is the Winner. I already knew from the beginning Android is always at the top. Thank God Android is still number 1. As a low budget Smartphone user. Android is always with me. And iPhone Sucks
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i also have two phones-iphone-12 mini and iphone 14 pro max
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The title makes no sense, you can't compare ""iPhone"" against ""Android"". The former is a phone, a physical device. The latter is an operating system. The proper title would be ""iOS vs Android"" or in the case of comparing devices: ""iPhone vs [insert an Android phone here]"""
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I’ve lost friends over this topic haha - nicely done. 

One thing I’ve noticed as I’ve aged is the excitement factor, new tech, and customization used to be very high on my list and now are very low. I can figure out most things tech but I just don’t care like I used to. So I just go Apple for their build quality, ease of use, and stay in apple ecosystem for things like iMac / AirPods. And you mentioned iMessage and FaceTime which is nice when wanting to video your parents who are 70+ - it’s easier."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Whats the android phone he's using in this vid? It looks really cool
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I've vacillated between both.  I'm currently running a Samsung S21, but thinking about going back to Apple.  There were little things my iPhone 6S-Plus did that none of my Androids have, like knowing when I'm in the car and automatically activating bluetooth.  With my Samsung, if I don't remember to do it, it doesn't happen.  And even when I do remember to do it, it's slow about it.  Apple also has really solid end-to-end encryption for privacy, whereas Android will essentially roll over hand your info to anybody who asks for it.   I've also had more glitchy apps on Android than with Apple.  It was easier to understand what people were saying on a phone call with the Apple, maybe because of better speaker hardware.  

Android is kind of the wild country ecosystem.  There's a lot going on, not all of it good, not all of it bad, and not all of it works properly, but it's damned interesting.  Apple is kind of the castle ecosystem.  Everything is reassuring and safe.  Everything works the way it should.  There are rules, and everybody follows them, like it or not.  And when something is proven to be a good idea in the Android world, it'll someday make it to Apple...when it's polished and shiny enough.  An Apple device has manners and is never messy, unlike those ""other"" phones.  

Foldable phones have really grabbed my attention of late, and I'm really interested to see the One+ Open when it comes out, but the foldable market is in its infancy and not everything works well.   So, for the money, I'm thinking of maybe going with Apple again, even though the 15 really hasn't changed much from the 14, aside from USB-C.  Maybe it would be an easier decision if these phones weren't so damned expensive nowadays."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,You forgot one massive edge to Android. Price points. You can get an Android phone for 50 bucks and the variety is vast compared to iPhone.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"You inspire me so much, thanks for the video Marquin."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,But when your old iphone gets the new update it gets slower  and slower 😂😂😂
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,What about price? He didnt even mention that.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Look, I'll be honest, I bought the iPhone 12 mini to see what all the hype is about & was quite disappointed. Maybe it's because I come from an actual Android background & I'm spoiled for that. I mean, we got customization out of the box (which means cleaning cache, using UAD (Universal Android Debloater) to remove bloatware, root access to modify ram & rom, Split Screen technology to multi-task instead of exiting apps, 3rd party app repositories to get more space for internal memory, and a plethora of brand options with different price points. Apple is pretty basic much like a Glock out of the box whereas Android is like a sniper rifle. The only good feature for me on Apple was Garageband because I'm a musician & if you have an idea for a good groove, you can do quick recording & implement other instruments to aid you in the process. There's also their software updates apart from my previous addition. At the end of the day, whoever is choosing what product is highly subjective. I mean how long did it take Apple to get PiP (Picture in Picture)."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Like how apple's repair service works, I mean it's so great 🙄"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,One of the biggest features I miss about android that I wish was on iOS is multitasking/multi window and pop out window support. There are so many times where I’m using two apps at the same time and keep flipping back and forth between them and it would be so much easier and more efficient if I could just have one app on the top screen and the other app on the bottom screen. APPLE PLEASE ADD THIS
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Wasted my 18 minutes. Knew the answers already, so did the conclusion, same talks since 2018.
I think phone tech and these techtubers have reached saturation.
Funny thing is YouTube algorithm doesn’t suggest me these anymore. 
Suggested me this as I searched for iPhone 15 launch."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,What about environmental impact? This is the most important category to me. Ill go without any feature to support a more environmentally friendly company. Love your work bro but not including environmental impact in reviews is terrible.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"And don't forget that none of the iDevices have fast charging, at least none I know of."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The Apps and Ecosystem points you gave to Apple seemed to be in praise of the walled garden nature of the company. That being said I 100% agree on Apple's point for ease of use.

Side note, with the new laws passed in the EU it would seem Apples walled gardens are about to come crashing down."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Like everything in life, there is only one right answer:
""It depends.""
If you like to do crazy and cool stuff with your phone and want a big range of prices, go with Android.
If you want stability, convenience, and a great out-of-the-box experience, go with the iPhone."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I used android from 2010 to 2019 and iPhone from 2020 to now and I definitely like iPhone better. Although that ROG phone is temping
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Can we just appreciate how he made the colors on the background the iMessage blue and android green!
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The limitations of Apple has been my biggest turn off from day 1
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"This was a great video and your reasons were super well thought out. Although, I can't believe that you didn't mention side loading apps during the apps category. I don't know whether it would be enough to flip the result, but it is definitely an important point to be made in the category."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Idk what to say about apps category. Yes they are delivered faster on IOS but the quality it's doubtful. Had problems with the game Asphalt 8 were it was stuck in a loading loop, Facebook Messenger didn't pushed notification and Instagram still looks horrible on Ipads with the black bars to the side... , also many websites don't bother to update their pictures to scale with retina displays so some of them are pixelated as hell.

The lack of navigation buttons takes some getting used to but it makes a ton of sense and gives you back space. The best thing is no bloatware, you can even uninstall Apple's apps. There's a unified way to change settings, everything just works etc. Only downside to iOS is transferring files from computer over USB is a pain, iTunes sucks so bad, especially if you have your own music library outside of Apple's ecosystem."

Android has gotten very bloated and to function properly the lower end phones do not function very well. I am little hard of hearing and the lower end Samsung phones have low volume even on speaker. Android does make changes to the OS simply so users can't find how to make changes on their phone with each update. If I go online and look up how to make a setting change on my OS version it never has the same options that I have.
I just got my first iPhone (SE 3) in the past week and I am impressed especially with the volume control and the intuitiveness of the phone. Android is no longer intuitive."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Some of these arguments are extremely skewed, which is to be expected, considering you are comparing a phone to an OS. IOS is extremely constraining, to the point where you don’t have even Whatsapp on an iPad, or if you installed Apps from different accounts, you will almost never be able to use them again.
Regarding ease of use, the only difference is marketing and user education, being stuck in the same system for 15 years would do that to you. If you take someone who never used any of the two, they will learn how to use it just as easily on both, as Android devices can be dumbed down to the level of the user anytime. My parents are almost 70 and they have always used Android phones and never had a problem with it."

comfort wise maybe.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The deciding factor for me is Apple has complete control over software and hardware working as one. For me phone, laptop are productivity tools and the tech has to get out of the way. I was an early Android user and loved it but hated the fact as soon a phone was end of sale (which wasn't long in those days) getting updates became a computer science project. I'm using a 5 year old iphone (Xs Max) today and it still runs the latest OS updated automatically. Google Pixel now comes close in integration of hardware/software but the Chromebook doesn't cut it as the laptop side of the ecosystem. Microsoft has the Surface but gave up in the mobile OS race years ago. I'd say it comes down to if you love tech explore Android if you see tech as just a tool, go Apple, both are valid choices."

Just recently turn to apple. I feel a lot can be done using iphone, rather than android. Sure, u miss a lot of customization thats not on apple. But you can get like a lot of productivity, hardware better & camera better with iphone. And so far, my only problem is battery health for iphone 14 pro max."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I don't buy in the fact that Apple's ecosystem is better because Apple limits you inside this ecosystem. That's a no-go for me. In fact, the comparison is pointless because the consumer targets for Apple and Android are different. Apple targets tech illetrates wanting something exclusive and working. Wheras Android targets 2 types of consumers: the ones left in the dust due to price (entry level) and the techo geeks wanting to exploit all possible features by tuning the phone."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"as for software n chipset iphone wins.. but other android 
 phones wins"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I strongly considered iPhone in 2021, but ended up with a Pixel 6 because the price played a huge part.  I'd only been on Android before and Pixels seem to be the best presentation of that in terms of features and software.  Plus I liked the design.  Almost two years later, it's still running great.  The fingerprint scanner totally sucks and the battery life is a mess, but I'm happy with the UI.  

There are a couple of things pushing me toward Apple's direction though:  A major one is that I got a Mac Studio and a MacBook Air within the last year and am amazed at how seamlessly they work together out of the box.  I use them together just because I can.  If the iPhones and Apple watches are anything like this, then ecosystem would be a major factor.  My Samsung watch ""mostly"" works with my Pixel.  It was solid with the Galaxy S10, but still...  Sometimes text notifications just don't come over.  Even the Messages app on the phone sometimes misses a text.  Carrier issue or software/hardware, I don't know.  The other, which may be related, is that I'm just tired of bugs and troubleshooting apps and connectivity.  I'm sure Apple's stuff will occasionally screw up too, but I hear much less from iPhone users about Bluetooth problems or the camera app crashing or the GoPro app not working with your old camera because the OS was updated.  The infamous ""it just works"" factor is very compelling. 

The things that may keep me on Android are the assistant and price.  I use Google apps for everything, so a Google phone is easy.  Or even Samsung plus Nova Launcher.  Would it be difficult or possible to get Google Assistant to work by default on Carplay?  With Google Assistant and Android Auto, I can just start on my phone and it automatically takes over in the car.  There's also the price thing again.  It would be quite easy to just upgrade to a Pixel 8 Pro, use my old Pixel buds, and maybe just update the watch.  There would be a better camera in a phone that will cost $200 less and let me do more.  

I definitely prefer Mac vs. PC now after a lifetime of Windows and I'm sure that diving into the whole ecosystem would be convenient, but I'm not sure if it's worth the extra cost of the hardware.  I simple stable OS is great for desktop/laptop, but I think the big value with mobile/car is Google Assistant.  That makes this a tougher decision."

There is more to this... a lot of corporations are blocking usb drives and if you are working on the go wifi tethering is the only thing that works from iPhone. Android however allows teetering via cable which is more secure than wifi. It is easier to listen to wifi shared than cabled shared internet.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The argument of ""are we going to get a feature that Android already has"" doesn't really make sense because the feature being added to the iOS ecosystem is more important than it being added to the Android ecosystem for an iPhone user.  They are totally different platforms and while being patient is frustrating, Apple waits until it makes sense and is polished. But that same exact feature in iOS is different than it being on Android if you're not an Android user.  The argument would be how that feature WORKS within the platform it was added to, regardless of who did it first.

Android is better than it used to be, but it's still too fragmented and there is no consistency in the design language. iPhones are beautiful and the hardware goes hand in hand with the OS. So with how fragmented Android is it's hard to compare because there's a different phone that does something very well, rather than a single device that does it all.  The iPhone not being fragmented will be the ultimate phone with all the features in one device by the end of its life cycle.

If Android phones want to add the latest camera but it hurts design they don't care they'll slap a huge ugly black bar on the back of a Google phone for instance and change the whole look.  But I would love to own BOTH devices... as Android I feel is more of an enthusiast device if you enjoy messing around and tinkering with bleeding edge and being essentially a beta tester.  I was an Android fan up until the iPhone 5 came out and then I've been using iPhone ever since and I love it. But I still think Android does some cool things... but not enough in one single device to make it worth switching."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Both phones are solid, but I made my switch from Samsung to Apple earlier this year and have not looked back. Apple has all the accessibility I needed so I don't have to bounce back and forth between two different OS's. The Apple eco system is bar-none, way what you want. I'd say both phones hold their own in their own ways and both have great value, but I found real value in the Apple eco system and how fluid and easy it is to use.  That's where you get your money's worth. Also, even when I was strictly an Android/Samsung user, I always felt even though Apple came out with features later, they usually did it better. I was always comparing my phones to my friends who used Apple and  saw how much better the same features were."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple does have seamlessness and environment down pat but the walls they put up for their own users to not dive into more OS capabilities like file explorers and such will never make sense to me. iOS is also a lot less intuitive to me - android has a dedicated back button but I have to search for it on each screen on iOS for example. the options are nested makes more sense on android for me too.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Good evening… just a thought. Taking into account that patents in general are limited to 20 years of use and that there is great importance in combating commercial monopoly, because in our country we cannot start a discussion about patents for computer operating systems and portable devices. Apple has had IOS for 16 years and Mac Os for over 21 years. Apart from Windows, which was designed in 1995…

Brazil, for example, has had very positive experiences regarding the management of patents in the pharmaceutical industry in relation to generics and the fight against the AIDS epidemic.

Wouldn't it be interesting for us, as a community, to at least propose debating this, as our legislators may in the future regulate these patents in an understandable way in our country. After all, computers and portable devices are in common, daily use by our population in almost all commercial, cultural and social areas."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I notice you didn't mention durability or how long a phone lasts. Are they generally the same? Does it depend heavily on which Android phone? Apple makes a lot of money off repairs and to me is one of the greediest, most self-centred companies in existence and they may be the most valuable. I don't think I can trust them to look out of my interests when it comes to how long their devices last or if they can take a bit of a beating.

I'm hoping you've thought this through but maybe you haven't. I'll have to look elsewhere for answers, including from an ethical point of view. Apple doesn't put touchscreens on their MacBooks because it would undercut sales of iPads. What other things have Apple done to make more money by not giving me what I actually want or what is actually best for me?"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,is the fold phone pixel or something?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I think that, both phones are good and powerful. What is important in the selection criterion of a buyer or user is his taste and mood, which phone he chooses. What is important is whether he communicates with the phone or not?  Or what does he expect from his ideal phone?  Definitely, both phones have their strengths and weaknesses, and each one is designed and built for users with different interests, moods, and expectations.  For example, working with iPhone and iOS phones will be annoying and boring for a professional user, on the other hand, working with Samsung and Android phones will be difficult for a user who only does his daily tasks with the phone.  Of course, an important point that was not mentioned in the video is having a variety of Samsung products with every economic budget, in many countries, especially in Asia, the Middle East and South America, the price of the iPhone is outrageously high, which is not economical in terms of  I think this is an important advantage that makes the Samsung phone superior to the iPhone in choice."

that being said the latest xperia has one of the best cameras around.

for my use its gonna be android. always"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I love my iphone but occasionally I find things about it that I absolutely HATE.
Like right now, I just desperately want my android tablet to automatically connect to my iphone hotpot. Can't do it, apple says no, they WILL say yes if you buy an ipad, I don't need a 500 dollar ipad to read books...

It generally goes: 
Pick up tablet, that's right, no network available
Pick up and unlock iphone
open settings
open hotspot
return to the tablet
open network settings
connect to iphone
wait while it connects
finally it connects
yeet iphone across the room
finally begin reading. 

WHY, there's a password for a reason, JUST LET THINGS CONNECT! Same deal with the android headunit in my car, just let it connect automatically ffs...

So anyway, I think I'm going to buy an android now because my priority is TIME and apple keeps fking with my time, sorry to the wife for the green text messages, I believe in our marriage and we can overcome this hardship!😆"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,It's interesting that outside the US Whatsapp is basically the imessage and facetime replacement that everyone uses and for that it doesn't really matter which phone you use
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"As an older guy now, I was an original Android user back to the original Motorola Droid, but with every passing Android I had more and more software and app issues with things crashing etc.  I also didnt like the cheap feeling build quality.   What changed me to an Apple user was my old company swapped to Apple products for their company devices and I was forced to use an Apple.   Never used one before so I took it home over the weekend to get a feel for it and I kept finding myself saying ""well that was easy.""     ""Why doesn't android do it like that?""   I also noticed that when I did anything, it didn't crash.  Everything just worked the way it was intended.    

 I'm one of those guys who falls into the ease of use category for sure.    Admitted the iPhone can't do alot of the extra stuff an android can do, but Apple does all the stuff I need it to do and it doesnt break down in the process.  The best way I can describe my experience has been... I upgrade my Androids when they break,  I upgrade my Apples when I want to."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"it looks kinda strange that you didnt talk about Google ecosystem. They have A LOT of thing that connect together, doorbell, ""security cam"", house heating control, etc."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"That is the beauty and beast of Apple: the ecosystem. I would switch back to Android in hot second if they had some cohesion in the ecosystem. Just the ability of my headphones/airpods to be able to automatically recognized by my watch, phone, laptop, iPad, and TV without any weirdness is worth it. The slow (years behind Android) development is almost enterprise like. It keeps the platform more stable, but has really become quite boring and stale. USB C, woo hoo! Yawn. Right now you can get a Oneplus 11 with really decent specs for 600 bucks, but again, that Apple ecosystem keeps me here. And yes, I am upgrading to the 15 Pro Max from a 13 Pro, and yes, I am excited about it."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Two things I'm missing is repearability, which is huge nowadays and longevity. You could say things for both, but IMO repearability is definitely Android point and longevity more so for iOS (most of the time you can keep your iPhone for 4 years and an Android for 3). 
I don't fully agree with the ecosystem as Vendor lockin is a real thing with apple. For example with Garmin, an Android can send and read messages, while an iOS can only get the notification that there is a message. If you want a watch to work well with your iPhone, you need an apple watch. 
As a cross-platform developer, I would also like to add my two cents about developer experience and why there are more apps for Android. Two reasons, when building for iOS you need a MacOS device, period. Also the developer account for Android is 25$ once and for iOS it's 99$/year. So for a young inexperienced developer, you can't start with iOS (or at least it will cost you a lot more). There is indeed less hassle to get a layout working, but that is nowadays really no work at all (at least not in Flutter). What is more work is getting your iOS builds working, they very often break without any reason.  
And lastly the stores. You don't know how annoying it is to get your app approved. Google play and appstore both are truly a horrible experience, but the reviewers on apple's side are very often such a pain 😅I made an app for my wedding and it was not allowed on the appstore as it was for to few people..."

I've have had so many conversations started because of it. I've caused like 6 sales for Xaomi by simply using it near people. Just having the option for a phone like this is the reason why I daily drive an Android. It's just great."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Yes
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about affordability? I think that's a pretty BIG check point (not talking flagships)
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,My choice is android that have more freedom than the iPhone holding its customers as hostages with pay pay pay!
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I disagree that samsung ui is harder to use for first time android users but apple is just significantly harder to adapt to.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android is always the real winner (ex-iPhone user).
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"When it comes to apps and ‘quality over quantity’ the same could be argued for features. Android has tons of features but even with the example in the video about switching refresh rates. 1. How many people know that exist? 2. Is it available on EVERY android phone? 3. Do we consider iPhone handles variable refresh rates instead of the user?

More specifically with quality over quantity. Both have faceID but does anyone on android use or care about it? Obviously yes iPhone removed touch ID"

*First this is my word domain.
*I've tested this for a very long time juts to know what's was on people mind, about that! 
I've selected most of the time very mature people ond mist of the time does who don't know how to use a phone at first like my old grandma, I've realized that people found that Apple was to complicated to use at first in needed time  to learned ex: like : Opening an App close it or goes back to the last page l, switch apps, was a lot more easier to do on an Android. As they only have to press one button to back, one for home, and one for menus.  As for Apple swiping is not really something that people will get use at first.
And that was one of the main reason oldies never like Blackberry Phones as they were too focus on swipe..."

Broken devices, replacements, and upgrades are painless when the entire environment can be replicated on a new device with a single initiation procedure. Start the process, walk away, and return to a fully functioning device. Android and Mfr processes vary and are too easy to screw-up."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I would add cost effectiveness which Android would definitely win. I remember buying a $400 Pixel 3a phone that could take better pictures than any iPhone at the time. It was awesome.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The winner is clearly android, specifically samsung."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"As always, jumping to the side of iphone. (How much you earn for that?)
I consider my samsung not good but using iphone makes me sick.
I can throw a lot of garbage on apple but just gonna mention one thing he think is ""good""
Support 24/7: iphone users are happy.
Me as android user: never needed to call anyone or visit any shop for support/claims/repair."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I would argue in the apps section each gets half a point since on Android while you might get lower quality apps you get a lot more customization where you can install all sorts of emulators and maybe some tools for automation and all kinds of setups.

This would make both OSs get the same amount of points and feed into the cliche that each is good in its own way, but this is kind of true anyway.

To keep it short if you have extra money and want a phone that's ""easier"" to use in a way, that you don't need to do customization choose an iPhone, if you want to customize the phone and do all sorts of stuff without your freedom being restricted get an Android.

P.S. The phone market is very mature so picking any phone is pretty good anyway. (If above a certain price)"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"It's funny because they have that ecosystem benefit by default, not by design as everyone thinks. I get that it doesn't really matter much to most. It just is what it is to everyday people. But it slightly annoys me that they think this setup was somehow brilliantly planned and engineered this way (mostly based on some loose quote about liking control from Jobs) when it was really just the mere fact that there was no other true smartphone OS in 2007. There was dumbphones, and there was the new iPhone option. It was all brand new and 3rd party companies had no idea it was going to be anything of the world changing magnitude it became now. Before that they just a device once and that was that end of story. There were no such things as app and OTA OS updates. Phones just came how they came and then you got a new one a year or 2 later. In order for Android OS to break in to the very early days of the market afterwards in 08 they had to partner up with all of these cell carriers, phone makers, and 3rd party companies for their distribution like Samsung LG HTC Moto, cellphone carrier stores, Amazon etc) where Apple already had their grandfathered in independent sweetheart deals made to sell directly without the additional branding and distribution when no 3rd party companies had realized the $ in partnering up and exclusive deals/distribution arrangements yet."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,This reminds me of car history shows that on 1950s-1990s cars and how massively competitive they were. Felt like on the consumer side everybody won really.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"In the ""app"" category, I dont think iOS can win until you can sideload an app without jailbreak or rooting. And I don't think iOS will ever do that."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,This video is so practical! Thanks man! ❤
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its incredibly unfair that its one operating system versus so many variations of android. These videos are the simple reasons why apple users would go on to use this in an argument and stereotype every android into 1 category to say that apple is better.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"$799 for 60hz screen, 6g+128gb storage, in 2023? Apple must have been under US sanctions for the past 4 years."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android for the easy win‼️
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I think value and build quality are 2 important cateogires that should also be considered, with Android having better value and Apple having better build quality."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,At the end of the day I was a big android fanboy but got so burnt on the buggy software and shit being slow. Switched to iPhone and haven’t went back. Sometimes it annoys me but I just get over it lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I have been running an iPhone since 2007 with a two month hiatus to an android in between iPhone 4 and 5. I will say that the phone themselves without the operating system goes to android hand down - zero competition from Apple. The quality, look, feel, and handling of a Samsung or pixel or LG is phenomenal compared to the iPhone. The OS in my opinion (as a normal every day user) goes to Apple. If I could run iOS on a Samsung S model, it would be the perfect phone. I guess that will never happen but it’s what I would want in my pocket if it was available."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"All that iMessage, FaceTime etc... it's a thing in the US. The rest of the world doesn't have that ""complex"". And ease of use man, as you said if you can customize everything on Android you make it easy to use as you want."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"For me, I love the iphone camera and how clean it looks but i am someone who cares a lot about customization plus, call me crazy but for the last few years i have had huawei phones and even though they definitely not the coolest in the market, my comfortability with them has made them the easiest to use for me so i might be the only one to say this but: i am loyal to huawei"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I constantly move from Android to Apple and vice versa. There is always something I miss from Android when I use Apple and miss Apple when I use Android 😅.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Why did you even make this video, bruh?"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Did he say thread instead of X
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"To be fair, i don't think the iPhone is easy to use. The settings/options/layout are not intuitive, Siri can't tell me the weather to save her life let alone trying to open an app, and I've had an iPhone for work for the last 3.5 years and it took me way too long to figure out how to attached a file to an email.

Google's ecosystem, especially paired with a smart home is very impressive."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"How about both sides stop crying all the time, and just accept people prioritize different things in life."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Iphones really arnt anything special from someone who owns one😂 yes they have very powerful chips but realistically 99% of iphone users will never utilise the full power of there chips, the best thing about iphone for me is who they feel personally theres no other phone that feels as nice in the hand as an iphone! But when it comes to features and getting your moneys worth along with quality speed and fantastic cameras and audio androids are still way to advanced! It seems everytime a new iphone comes out its always a new chip never packed with new helpful features like an android!🤷‍♂️"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Excitement should go to Apple because Apple users are more excited for the new features (even if already in android) than android users. Apple users also know when Apple releases a feature, it’s going to be perfect. Can’t say the same about android."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Biased. Not everyone sees customization as a plus how can it be a factor
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,How much did Apple pay you for this? Lmao
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Can I redo your logo?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I love that apple gives updates/support for as long as they do and this is coming from an android user but let's also be completely honest, what percentage of users especially apple users are using a 5+ year old phone, and even if apple gives OS updates that really doesn't matter since most apps lose compatibility after a few years forcing you to upgrade your phone anyways and this is true for both android and ios.  I think the best practice is to take and use the best of both worlds and stay as vendor neutral as possible...personally I use a android phone, ipad tablet, and windows PC and have all 3 working together without any issues."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I have tried an iPhone, and it doesn't work for me. My Samsung Z Fold 4 fits my needs. I also do a little gaming, and Apple's computers can't match my system."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Things nobody talks about:
iOS:
- Relies on servers to work at all, and thus can be bricked by Apple if Apple choses to or of the iCloud servers are shut down
- Does not have a proper way to copy data to a computer (only has PTP for photos, and requires a special protocol that can only copy everything at once)
- Is encrypted on multiple levels
Android:
- Has very easy app sideloading (not locked to a first party app store)
- Has much more connectivity freedom (MTP, PTP, CD gadget mode, USB mass storage mode, Bluetooth file transfer)
- Does not require signed operating system and is open source (can be bootloader unlocked, and root gives full access, while jailbeaking is much less supported by third party)"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,When google had its nexus line it got updates fast and for quite a while even say nexus 7. Got all updates for years.  Sometimes they werent official.  But was still able to run latest updates
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I had both and I like iPhone because I don’t need all those extra features and extra stuff I’m supper simply the only thing I think iPhone missing is having 2 apps at once and the ability to move the apps where ever you want
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Bro, Marques, as a Mexican I can tell you that the spanish dub of your videos is unbearable to watch. It's like going from 4K to 480p. I'd advise to do it better or dont do it at all."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I absolutely HATE seeing ""iPhone vs Android"", for a simple reason. iPhone is a product name, Android is an operating system. I would be totally find with it if people just said iOS vs Android. If you compare the hardware, you don't say ""Android"" just because it runs Android, you don't call Nokia phones ""Symbian"" or ""Nokia OS"". If you compare the Google Pixel with the Apple iPhone, you should call it Pixel vs iPhone, and why not compare two phones that run Android, like Galaxy vs Ascend. It's not right to use words that compare Apple to everything else on the market as if there is more than just the big mother company Apple, and the rest is just some wanna be Apple, but it's Android. I see the words ""iPhone vs Android"" multiple times a day and it gets me super mad every time. I know nobody ever reads my comments and definitely nobody cares about this but personally it drives me crazy. Please compare two things that are of the same type, while programming you can't say (bool == int), it's not the same thing!"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,That's the problem with Marquez he's kind of like warm milk there's nothing nothing super exciting about it you know what it's going to be like cuz he always takes the same direction. Never say anything that will offend anyone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think it's not Iphone vs android! it's Apple vs lot's of android company ......
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"he's right on the ecosystem thing. however, in my scenario it's different. My family of 6 uses all samsung so instead of airdrop, we use quickshare and it truly does affect a person when buying a phone because if I change to iphone, it'll be hard to share media with my family. I agree with the customization too. I use mac and ipad but for some reason i cant let go of my samsung phone because of the customization that im used too. he's right, we don't need to use only one brand, switch it up to fix your needs."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,4:12. Wrong. Samsung Galaxy records 8k videos with good stabilization (waiting for 8k 60 fps in Samsung). No iPhone does that. It is a day and night difference when you look at 8k video playing at 4k monitor/tv and 4k playing on 4k. It is a completely different quality and details in image when we talk about 8k videos from S23 for example. All iPhone lovers like you will ALWAYS never raise this topic. Because iPhone only has 4k recording.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,And after twenty years Apple still doesn't have split screen where you can have two apps open to the same time on an iPhone. You can do it on an iPad. Very sad
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I don't recall iPhones suddenly catching fire inside of people's pockets!... Having been an Android user for a decade, I made the switch three years ago. I used to root my Android, install custom Roms, do everything a super user (nerd) would do to make an Android phone my own. Those customizations always came at a cost. Plus, if you aren't using a Google phone, you have to wait for three approval processes before a security update will be applied. Google has to hand it off to Motorola, Samsung, LG, etc. and then must be handed off to each carrier to add their development thorns, and then updates come OTA. With iPhone, and now Google Pixels, you get them directly."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forget performance
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Main feature from iOS that I would like to see on Android is: all pics exchanged in a messages conversation grouped together with that contact.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Another major category that should be taken into account is Choice of hardware and form, of which Android would be a clear winner.

Android all the way."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Marques, you forgot a BIG category, PRICE, there is no cheap iPhone relative to Android and a lot of people aren't going to spend $400US+ (it's $1400 our dollars here) for a phone and as far as I know, that's where the iPhone starts out. Also, like another commenter said, serviceability/reparability is very important and apple straight shits the bed there."

Initially I was psyched on the hardware, but eventually the reactivity slowed down to the touch like the $30 walmart androids, the main difference is I spent $1,800 for the disappointment this time. Plus they had to replace it twice because the folding screen kept getting the black bar and losing touch controls. Back to apple as soon as the 15 drops and I couldn't be more impatient rn."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,As usual.. USA= the world 😂
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Great and very reasoned analysis. I am an android devotee and have been since I put aside my Sony Ericsson phone for an HTC Hero 100 (now I'm devoted to Samsung). I appreciate the Apple ecosystem and totally get the appeal of the accessibility they have with all their products. My wife uses an iPad over her laptop for teaching and note taking. Both operating systems are more than we could've hoped for just a few years ago and I think it is all dependant on what flavour you prefer nowadays.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I would disagree on apps... genuinely it should be draw atleast.. you can easily sideload almost every app ..be it ios based Instagram & whatnot. Also the options we have not stucking in Monopoly of particular app store blocks certain apps for political reasons or not getting more money from developers.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"It's incredible that cost /ValueForMoney wasn't one of the categories.  Cost (or at least value for money) is one of the biggest reasons as to why people buy one product over another.  But maybe if you get all kinds of freebie samples to review, cost doesn't matter.

You can get some very good mid-range android phones these days for 250-400 USD these days.  There really isn't such an option for the iphone (except for the SE with its tiny screen).  250-400 USD would buy you a used iphone in the iphone 7 - iphone 12 range."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"If you get “excited” over “features” then you’ve created a dependency where the winner of one automatically wins the other, which should be avoided."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Great video, wise sentence in the end. I was using Androids for many years (LG, Motorola, businesses Nokias with Symbian also) but when started with iPhone 8, now 13 mini I do not want to step back. Easy to use and stability for years (had iP8 for 5 years) is most important for me. Even if I liked to customize Android in the past now I am tired of this. I just want to live and use smartphone as a helper:) so iPhone is my choice now:)"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The winner is..........................................................HUAWEI~~~
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The mere fact that an iPhone can hold up for a whole decade (based on experience) and Android phones slow down after just a few months of using it (based on experience)? Yeah, iPhone ALL THE WAY. Worth my money and truly becomes an extension of my hand that I don't have to worry about, ever."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Yeah, iPhone takes the win. For sure. No doubt."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,saying apple hates changing things for 'no good reason' is a wild statement
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I was already convinced by iphone due to the incorporation of the usb c when it was announced, but this video made me 100% sure that I'll be buying the iphone 15. I want a phone I could use for 5+ years, and as a forever user of android, i can testify the OS turns to shit 2-3 years into a phone. thanks MB!"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Price is not a factor?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"As a software engineer there are various points that make me turn up my nose:

- When we talk about features, all those features that are missing on iOS due to the slowness to conform to standards (such as the impossibility of using WebXR due to non-compatibility with Safari) are not mentioned. But the point still went in favor of Android so no harm done.

- Speaking of apps. One of the reasons why the AppStore has fewer apps than the PlayStore is that to keep an app on the former you have to pay an annual fee while on the latter there is only a one-time fee. An independent developer who has created a utility app and wants to make it public for free and/or open source cannot do so because it would have an absurd cost to bear. Apple's policy doesn't lead to better apps, it just leads developers to place advertising or paywalls inside apps to make money from them.

- Still talking about apps. It's true that for Android you need to develop for multiple formats, but it's also true that Android provides more tools to adapt to this. It is also true that, if we move on to the iPad, 50% of the applications are an adapted iPhone version. To date, there is still no WhatsApp app for iPad!

- Regarding the ecosystem, it should be mentioned that since Apple has its own laptop and Android does not, the compatibility and speed of interaction between Apple devices is not comparable to that between Android devices and Windows/Apple/Linux devices"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Hmm getting the iPhone is expensive, gotta buy a macbook and that kind of stuff"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Can I add two more categories?
Service and Repairable - Android
Security - iOS"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Price is also a factor that drives the choice, iPhones don't have much discounts vs premium Android."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"A lot of times, people debating this make the same ""mistake"" that you made for the first two categories. This is not to say that you made the wrong conclusion, but I think its important to compare things a little more fairly. Android has MORE features, and MORE customization. Fully agreed with you there. But it is also important to consider which has the more complete and better working features and customization. I am not saying iOS wins there, I am just saying there is a difference. More is not always better. You even say it in this video when talking about apps, ""Quality over Quantity"""
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I do not care about all of this. I buy iphone być it looks good and expresie. Also i do not change anything in my phone and keep it as it was when i buy it. I use Google chrome and Messenger. And sometimes i make ph call
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Nice review :) Just one point as to why companies prefer to develop mainly for ios: I worked as an app developer for quite some years and it was always because of the revenue. Even with the same amount of people on both platforms, the revenue on ios is usually higher, since people owning iphones tend to spend more money on good quality apps. And one of the most annoying thing to develop around was always the apple notch, not only the android aspect ratio."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Emulation on Android > Emulation on IOS
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I predicted which one will win which category. I have been watching these kinds of videos way too much.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I think it’s kinda pointless to compare the two these days.  Honestly, both are so good, so refined, and so loaded with features that we’re just nit-picking the details.  The best one is the one that works for you, and I think that’s what Marques is trying to convey.  And that’s the honest-to-god truth, despite how corny it sounds.  iOS is really good.  Android is really good.  They both excel at pretty much everything.  Both will get you where you need to go and do what you need them to do.  And both also excel at their own things.  Figure out which of those things are most important to you, go with it, and be happy."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Threads… LOL
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The artificial limitations introduced by Apple should be enough to rate them low in almost all these categories l.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,To me an ecosystem in one that isn't limited to a specific brand. Android devices can conect with other devicese en if yhey aren't even smart devices.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The iOS filing system is an absolute mess. It duplicates photos and videos if you want to see them in the gallery.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,And that's exactly why I like iPhone.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Apple all the way if you want to keep your phone for 3+ years. My pixel phone taught me a hard lesson to never buy an Android phone if my life depended on it
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"As an android guy when my mom switched to the I Phone I had to look up how to help her for so much stuff I found easy on android
I think the android app store is better it has app's I use and couldn't live with out and this is a big deal barker to me "" also I-phone can't side load"" So to me android wins the app category hands down. Everything else I agree with"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The most basic feature I miss the most from Android on my iPhone is being able to change the volume for media vs phone ringing vs text, etc. It being all one volume bar on the iphone is bonkers to me. You're listening to music that was mixed low at a comfortable volume and then a text comes in that deafens you. The runner up feature I miss is having letters, numbers and symbols on one keyboard face (iPhone keyboard is STILL trash after over a year of having this thing. Thought I'd forget how it used to be...). I hope Apple changes these things, but more likely I'm going to stop caring about imessage group texts/facetime and go back to Android (for these reasons and the rest in the video)."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,He added eco system go give apple points.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"you should do an iPhone vs Samsung Galaxy vs Android video.  Samsung is a different category.  So many better options and features than any other android, they are not just ""Android"", there are 3 categories IMO."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android all the way for me....
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"It's mostly about what you are familiar with.  Knowing even some things to do is better than knowing nothing.  Unless you are a hopeless geek and have time to invest in learning new technology.  Most people don't.  So iPhone is still the dominant platform, because it was first.  Android is clearly superior and I have used both, most people who have used Android gave up on iPhone."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"These categories were verryyy good established by you Master. Very well thought as always…. but, as you stated that I could add my personal categories, right? Well, I would a new categories called: Content creator, Reviewer and Tech Savi.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"well done marques — this is why you make a good reviewer — you can break it down to a system that applies it to someone's personal needs, even if those needs differ from what is you. this allows you to enjoy techonology, without sucumbing to the usual fanboi tribalism of many channels. thanks for a good review!  five stars!  ✨"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Sorry. Cant agree on the apps category and even the ecosystem. In my opinion, the ecosystem should be supporting but not limiting.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Can you talk about the Huawei pro60, the satillite phone? Apparently under US $1000, would that be batter value of iPhone 15?"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"In my opinion my big thing, with my phone is video and picture quality and signal and being an android user for years vs iPhone as my job phone, android is better in my opinion but that's my opinion."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Honestly speaking while the focus modes are pretty neat I’d say it’s a real niche feature that most of Apple’s user base won’t even bother with outside of DND
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I work in a phone store and I always tell people it really just depends on the person and what you’re gonna be using it for.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"This video is truth for a specific demographic, which is
the demographic that watches your videos. You connect excitement with physical and software features… Go ask the avg Apple user, especially women, what feature they are most excited about…. Look at previous waiting in line videos and think about asking the majority of these people what feature they can’t wait to try. 😂
 Excitement shouldn’t be on this list."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,This was a great video! I like how you highlight how some things are more important to some people than others. All of the pros you talked about for Apple under the Ease of Use section is why I like it better. Easy to use OS and no bloatware.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"its always Apple, just based on the resale value alone.  Apple products resale value is so much better than Android products....Apple just has such a reliable product."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,What about privacy?  I’m under the impression apple wins that one but i could be misinformed
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Why's the hand clipping at 3:02-3:03 lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"You are very objective. However I have to point out that the ease of use goes to iPhone is also because they have less customisable features/features than android. It would be good that you can also cover security aspect which is important too. Nice to have a video just dedicated to that. 

Also in terms of support I have to give it to iPhone. They are way much better in terms of customer service. I am using a Samsung. Their services basically sucks. 

Thanks for the video. Well done."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,🎉 Great job. That’s actually one of the most fair comparisons I’ve ever seen.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I used to think iPhones were cool when I was in high school but I can't stand them now. I prioritize customization, look, feel, and efficiency which has ultimately led me to Android. The iPhones really only impress me with the ease of use so the only people I'd recommend them to are people like my grandma that just need a simple to use basic phone. Personally, I'd much rather have a phone that can do what I want it to with minimal effort opposed to jailbraking an iPhone to use basic customization options. Apple is a garbage company too so I'm happy not supporting them. Not to say Android companies aren't garbage but they're significantly better when it comes to the right to repair."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"For a person who lives in United States this category isn't important, but for me cost benefit is very important. I dunno in United States, but in my country even the most basic Apple Iphone is too expensive and Android is more flexible about price. Plus there are a lot of  people who just want their phone to send messages via WhatsApp or using basic apps and they will not pay the price of a premium phone just for that. Finally I will not start to talk about Apple very expensive ecosystem...."

See what I'm saying, most people don't realize that iOS is only in the iPhone while Android(which doesn't manufacture phones) fornicates with every Android-friendly device on earth.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"A really stupid way to compare. Updates and support as important as features and apps? And a little better gets the same checkmark as MUCH BETTER? For instance, Android customization would be a 9/10 and iPhone would be a 5/10. And that same 9/10 in customization shouldn't get as many points as even 7/10 for apps. A weighted system would have been much better. For instance, 5 points for customization, 10 points for apps, 3 points for updates/support.

Also, Samsung is far more flexible (dex for example) and updates more regularly than other androids (except google)."

You have compared the iPhone on iOS with a bunch of phones on Android. I wish I could choose more, like WP for example, or Symbian, but they are not existent anymore. The real deal for me now, when the phones became so equal, is the choice for the future. You've mentioned the ecosystem as the last criteria. When the prices are growing and the habits are taking root, you will not have the chance to choose in the future. It is sad that we have only 2 platforms for mobile devices, it's all bad. There is no right choice except the one's you've done when your personal or/and family ecosystem grew up too much. What I see is the fight between Twix sticks. There is no real choice anymore."

I switched to an iPhone a year back and iPhone just destroys Android in these two categories for me. In my experience, Android has a lot of bugs (even Pixels) and whenever I had to rely on an Android to get something done, it would mess up in the most innovative of ways. With an iPhone, you know it'll just work and that too beautifully. Also, Android performance has always worsened over time for me but iPhone has consistency here."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"As a first time Apple owner with the the rest of the family on the Apple ecosystem, it’s been seamless, I was reticent to join the collective but one of my colleagues said, Stuart it just works made me change after fighting for years.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Mmmmmm I have a slight feeling that the rating categories are a bit tilted towards being winnable by Apple. If even by a slight margin. Example - where’s hardware options and features…?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Just more of the same regurgitated stuff from the last 10+ years.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"18:10 heavily disagree, prices are climbing to the point where to get features and performance parity with a OnePlus 7cyou got to spend what that phone cost 4 years ago.

Some phones are actually worse than their previous versions.

In every category bar iPhone, the price has gone up a lot in the last 4 years. And that's adjusting for inflation and whatnot.

iPhone went down in price, tho, both relatively and absolutely."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,It's been like 10 months since I bought my realme GT neo 3 150W before I bust in the two weeks I was doing so much research about both iPhones and Android and finally decided to buy it and it was a very good decision for me because it has only feature that I want and it wasn't very good price also like 380$
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The only thing I hate from iPhone is how restricted they are with applications and banning third party apps. So I just use the iPhone as my main phone with a Pixel 7 as backup for things my iPhone lacks. Definitely not cost efficient, but I like to be able to do things on an Android which sadly won't work for the iPhone."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about Apple security philosophy. Surely that could be measured in their features / ecosystem and add some value to the iPhone. It is one of the many reasons why Apple is great.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Another thing that should have been mentioned when it comes to the apps category: some of the in-app purchases are more expensive on ios compared to android.

It doesn’t matter what I want. They are all Apple till death. They will never switch unless iMessage gets added to other phones. So I’m stuck with iPhone purely because I don’t want to deal with being an outcast and missing out on family or friend group texts. 

Out of my entire family on my side and my wife’s side, one person has an android. And we have large families all local to us."

""Ease of use"" is heavily dependant on what the person is used to. 

Got my grandma a cheap Android tablet for WhatsApp calls. Set it up for her, locked down a bunch of things she'll never need to touch, and it's perfect. Wouldn't be able to lock down the settings features on an iPad, that's for sure. 

There isn't a winner."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Samsung is superior + ratio.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Does it have 120hz, fast charging and emulation? If not, then its not the best. Many apps are locked behind iphone so theres no reason it should have won over android."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"People in third and second world countries will use android simply because they are more affordable. You can get an android phone with FB and all the social media apps with internet and a camera for 80 dollars and it's pretty usable, and brand new. That's speaking for us here in the Philippines, one of the most ""on internet"" countries in the world. Sure, USA and UK may have iPhone as their most bought phone but that's because people can afford it there. The rest of the world will still use Android phones. Android phone parts are also more accessible and the software system lends to better repairability, an important factor here since most users don't upgrade their phones every year and will be stuck with a phone for 3 or more years. There's also the ability of android to accept a different OS which lends to it's length of use. You can install a different OS for most android phones due to it's open source nature."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Where is the Price ? 😂
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Before I finish watching the video I know marquis will go with iphone. Let's see the results
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I am kind of in-between camps... I like the unique features on iPhones like voice isolation (I know Pixel 7 has the same, but you can only get that on Pixel 7//Pro, whereas it is on all modern iPhones). On the other hand, data sharing (wireless hotspot) sucks on iPhone -- it's a strange problem for such a basic feature, I don't understand why is it so difficult for Apple to get right...."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Wow he actually picked android. I'm shocked.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Another click bait video.  we know his answers will be depends what you like.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Apple has the best ecosystem, but android gets the best tech for the money and is less restricted"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"It’s been over a month since my switch back to iPhone (14 pro max) and I miss my Note 10+ SOOO MUCH. I’m finding apples “simplicity” to be a huge hindrance in terms of quality of life features. The best thing about iPhone is AirDrop and the streamlined texting interface that allows sending high quality video and the fact I can send stuff seamlessly to my other apple devices. But good god I miss my Android. Something about the customization of an android actually bolsters it’s ease of use in my opinion. Of course it’s super overwhelming for any new android user to have to learn all its capabilities, but once you’ve figured it out, android really lets you customize your phone to the way that’s most efficient for you and my setup was perfect.

(Also,Samsung quickshare NEVER worked the way it should’ve. Creating link files for apple users was pretty much useless because they could almost never get the files to load)"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Videos like this is why I’m a shareholder in both Apple and Alphabet 🤑

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I genuinely appreciate that someone with such a community finaly gets to have a bit of true objectivity, we're not there yet but aknoledging a different point calculation method based upon people's preference is a good leap forward, and I thank you for that. Another nice step forward would be to aknoledge that sometimes categories can have more subtle dissimilarities than they seem and different features don't make either of them necessarly bad but just different, you wouldn't advise people to use a spoon to cut through a steak however, you see where this is going... People will hate you for that but I guess it is in fact your job to go beyond that? despite the hype & all, 

for instance the ecosystem is not necessarily better on either side (as you said for smart devices for instance) the question is, can a casual user find a solution to overcome the lack of ecosystem native continuity, the other thing is : it's hard to lock yourself completely out of the standard ecosystem, since you will meet people that don't use apple devices especially outside the US, yes the android + windows will ensure you less convenient ease of use but it wil ensure compatibility and reliability with every device on earth 99,7% of the time (I've measured with my bear eyes) 

Edit : then again, I guess people would have freaked out if you didn't pick your side..

Good Job afterall, you are going in the right direction, it's good for your community"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Excellent comparison. Thank you!
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,M Brownlee really creates these categories specifically to make the Android - Apple race as close as possible so he isn't one sided lol. Have to keep the sponsors happy right!
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I agree — Apple here. Also with security. I get leery with Google seeming to harvest personal data without my consent
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Apple winning the apps section doesn't make sense. How is it that ease for developers and updates give point to apple while android offers more app choices, better prices and able to get ur apps literally from anywhere."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Great ending.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Change my mind: Text edition on iPhone is horrible.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,What I've noticed is Android users HATE iPhones meanwhile iPhone users are completely oblivious to the fact that anyone would want any phone other than an iPhone.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The iPhone is the winner coming from a galaxy user
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The Instagram or any e-commerce apps sucks on iPad. It just the same iPhone aspect ratio they show in iPad as well.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,May be i will try iPhone next year for their new USB C.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Well made video and informative! I will share some of my opinions on the subjects to note why I think Android is better in categories where iOS took the point:
1 - Apps: Quantity. I personally like it. There are many apps for Android that you can use to further CUSTOMIZE your experience with the phone. But you can also side-load apps. Is an app banned in your country? You can bypass that by downloading the apk online. Be a pirate if you want. Quantity is important. 
2 - Ease of use: Support was mentioned. Yes there are apple stores, but if your iPhone gets damaged you can only go to the Apple store. And we all know that they can be a bit scammy with it. Android however can be fixed at any privately owned phone/pc repair shop. And those are EVERYWHERE and in most cases it will not cost as much."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"For me they complete each other. I like to use mostly the ipad because it combines several apple devices in one (computer, phone, and gaming console) knowing well that its features  and  hardware quality will be relavant for a couple of years. With the ipad as good as the most recent one, i won't need an expensive phone. I'll get like a really basic and good (battery, camera, features) atleast. Then!, a windows computer to complete my setup and thats it, the ultimate devices all togother. My choice is also based on the fact that the apple ecosystem is expensive. So for accessories i will get good bluetooth headphones or earpieces from another manufacturer (there are alot) a smart android tv with sonos sound system. I dont really like watches (or bracelets either) so thats my dream ideal environment knowing that everything has its own unique role"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The winner for me is Android. But I like both

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Why are no one talking about price? I don't want to spend $800+ when my average screen time is 1.5 hours per day. I manage perfectly fine with a phone for 300-400$ while still having a new phone with new features and several more updates to come!
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its like messi vs ronaldo. It will never end
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Samsung vs Apple. Which would be the best if you compare in terms of just quality and reliability. Like which phone will depreciate in performance and battery life less after say 4 or 5 years.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I don't think the ecosystem matter that much because most people don't have 3-4 Apple products

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"i really appreciated the last part of the video where you acknowledge there's no clear winner, coz ""the best phone"" is a very personal opinion of every individual, and i agree with all the points you made. Because while im an android user, my parents are Apple users, and the ease of use Apple have really made using a phone easier for them, while I'm using androids for the customization and features it have over Apple."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I've used both iphone and android throughout the years, had an iphone for like +4 years (until it couldn't really do much) before that I bought the ""samsung galaxy s6"" and that was also something i had for +3 years until i switched to the iphone, recently switched to an oneplus (2023) tbh, it all comes down to ""can it use the apps i use? yes? okay"" and that's about it.."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"- Customization: You are correct.
- Featrues: You are correct.
- Ease of use: It's mostly about what you are used to. When I use my girlfriend's iPhone, I'm just as lost as she is on my Android. But I agree with you that not changing stuff is very important and Android does it more.
- Updates/Support: For my Pixel 6 (released 2021), it's like this: October 2024 for overall updates, October 2026 for security updates. You are talking in your video about security updates. So that's 5 years of security update my friend. You are wrong.
- Apps: Android has more apps, also all the mainstream apps are there. Fact that it might be more dificult for the developers (you are not a developer, you don't know what kind of tools devs have) is not your problem and shoudn't be a factor in this section. You are wrong.
- Excitement: Neither new iPhones nor Androids are interesting anymore. It's a mature technology. But yeah, Android is slightly more interesting. You are correct.
- Ecosystem: Not really an argument to me, but ok.

The real score: 2 for iPhone, 5 for Android"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"my biggest problem with this video is this ""ecosystem"" category. you're telling me that the cult-like design of the apple ecosystem, not letting anything else connect to it and charging exorbitant prices for the products, is better than the almost open market of products that fall into the ""android"" ecosystem, simply by virtue of not being branded as apple? the difference in cost between the two is incomparable; someone could buy a $200 android phone, a $50 smart watch, a $30 pair of bluetooth headphones, a $200 tablet and a $200 laptop and have the same amount of connectivity with the right apps as the $1000 phone, $2000 laptop, $500 watch, $800 headphones and $800 tablet. arguing that the apple ecosystem is more ""seamless"" falls pretty flat when you consider just how much you're paying for that convenience. not to mention that every device in the android camp can be further customized to do literally anything that anyone could need, where apple locks you into their padded room and drip-feeds their consumers with features android has had for a decade or more."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I don’t get how the camera upgrades get glossed over even having a 2x optical level quality on the regular iPhone. 
Also the screen brichtness will be very noticeable and useful for people who use navigations outside often. I think it’s a solid upgrade from the iPhone 12 or 13. I don’t think upgrading ANY phone from the previous year makes sense anymore"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,On pixel 7 I have focus modes
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Team IOS
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,All I know is that iPhone sucks
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I don’t agree with the ecosystem. They are not equal.
This point was between IOS and Samsung. So it was not between Android and IOS in my opinion.
Apple has an ecosystem between all their products and its been like this since ages.
Android has ecosystems depending on the manufacter.
I’ve used iPhone since the 7 Plus and recently tried to switch with S22 Ultra.
Bought for each all of their products and even if they are close in some ways, they are not."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"thank you so much for the video ,its so helpful"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android has clipboard...
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,My take during the ad... iphone cameras are like the matrix level good like it's fake they disect human eyes or something but android is better on every other aspect...
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"It’s all about personal preference for the average user, it’s always been that way. It’s the extremists that have turned it into a stupid hate iPhone war, just like everything else on the planet that gets turned into a love/hate war… the louder you squawk about something the more people join in on one side or the other. 

Also, 
10:56 - Anyone know what app this is?"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Hats off to Marques for teasing all of the new iPhone features without breaking the embargo. Well done, my friend!"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Having a full featured request desktop site mode on Chrome on Android makes Safari look like a toy on iPhone.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"One important criteria is missing, would be price / affordability. That would move the needle by a lot."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Why didn't he talk about performance and gaming...?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one of the best comparisons ever. excellent video marques.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I use a Windows Laptop. The problem with Apple's ecosystem is it completely breaks when I'm not using an Apple product.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I bought the iPhone 13 Pro Max when it come out and spent a lot of money on Apple devices. Last week I spent $2k going back to the Pixel and Google devices. Pixel is so much better than iPhone. Google products also.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Security.... Google will freely share your info where as in apple takes customer security significantly more serious
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,where's the Nokia column?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I don’t agree with the assessment that the apple ecosystem is better. Android integration with Google services and smart devices is a hundred times better. Add in Google assistant for voice control and it’s no contest.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Apple lost the update/support category and my business for life when they pushed out those battery/processor updates that pretty much made you feel like you needed to upgrade.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I would have liked him to include durability as one of the categories. I think this is another area where Apple wins and one of the biggest reasons I continue to use an iPhone.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,U.S. best phone is IPhone meanwhile the rest of the world is android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I just can't understand how people use iphone without a proper file system.
& not having settings of each app inside the app instead of going out of the app & to settings just to change a setting."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Sorry, ease of use should have been a tie or not included. They are both equally easy to use, in Android vs Apple. If you include Samsung, well even more so with it's simply mode which takes it even further."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Apple has the worst fans and elitism though so I feel that's a negative point there
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Excitement 😂 Bruh
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"It would be good if you added cost, since usually android phones are much cheaper than iphones."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Weird how you look around you have a prompter in 4 different angle?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Haven't watched this video yet, but I vowed a couple years ago to never go back to samsung, and my Pixel has been so disappointing in terms of battery life, I honestly think I might have to switch to iPhone. I already have airpod pros 2 which make the blow a bit softer."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"What else do you guys want to see respecting innovation 🤷🏻??? Both Android and iOS devices (phones, tablets, wearables, etc.) are miniaturized computing devices that the only thing they have done since they came out, is giving us incremental changes in the hardware, and a surprise here and there software wise, in the end and for years they all serve the same purpose: use consumer and communication applications nothing more, nothing less. Unless our smartphones go holographic, or implement some sort of future tech that make us feel like we are living in 2050, from my perspective innovation could come from AI and how to implement it at a biological level to enhance our current limitations as human beings. In this sense, I believe that wearables will have much more prominence in the coming years than smartphones."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Anyway each to there own’       Android.    You tell it what to do.        You can have the apple on your Android phone 📱.     Yeah .    So it’s very smart .     👍.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Funny, once again, like in so many little things in life, I don’t fit into any category. I want something that not only fits but can be operated in one hand, the third party finger ring thingy does that. I want it to be durable, the third party case does that. I care about the money I’ve already invested in the device such as the music I’ve downloaded over the years, Apple Music keeps me hooked in that regard. I just feel meh about all the new “features” that come along, the island, new gestures, blah blah… I’d so dump this big block of tech in my pocket if I didn’t need it to answer actual calls and I thought the watch would do that, except everytime I walk out the house without my phone my watch devotes it’s day to tell me I’ve left my phone at home until the battery runs dead at 3pm. So over all of them too busy competing with each other they don’t want to listen to people who just want to do people things."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"JUST MY OPINION: IOS focus on users that just want to use the phone, period! make calls, answer emails, msgs, etc. it is point forward! ANDROID focus on users that want to trick and install and hack and do shit like this. it all comes down to the preference of the person using."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,MB is a national treasure
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I watched this on the Revanced App that I sideloaded onto my Pixel.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"For me, I like to compare iOS and Android using the analogy of Android being a car, iOS being a motorcycle, both can take you from point A to point B, but Android is more clunky yet more practical while a bike is more efficient yet less practical than what a car can do."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Privacy and security is the most important feature. For that reason alone Android is a no-go for me.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Continuou Camera = Droidcam
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The biggest differentiator for me is privacy & security - and for that Apple has been the clear & consistent winner.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"For me:

Customization - 3
Features - 3
Apps - 2
Excitement - 2
Updates - 5
Ease of Use - 5
Ecosystem - 3

Apple - 15
Android - 8"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Nokia Lumia 1020 still the true winner
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,That's a great system! 💯
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,It’s the iPhone… is all I’ve heard 😂
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Probably the best iPhone vs Android video I’ve ever seen. In the end, it all comes down to personal preference, so it’s best to use a rating system where you have to consider which aspects are most important to you. Amazing video as always, Marques."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,It’s actually iPhone vs Samsung. Android is not the same in all phones. I’m sure all y’all techs know that already.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Your name is in the 9-12-23 apple event
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"""in the US"" was extremely important to point out. The rest of the world just uses WhatsApp and forgets about iMessages and FaceTime."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Apples and Oranges. But both are amazing devices. IPhones have the best looking pictures and im an android user for the past 12 years. 🎉
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iPHONE 15 PRO MAX SUCKS LOL
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"This was easily the best apple vs android comparison I've seen yet. I used to be apple but switched to Samsung 3 years ago because I just didn't get excited about apple anymore. For me, android is where it's at, and I still love my Samsung. I still get excited about it and often times find myself picking it up and opening it for not actual reason other than I just want to use it for something."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Read the Vanderbilt Google Data Collection study, will never use Android again."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Nice comparison! I would like to add something: Android phones, especially Samsungs, like the S22 or S23 series, are more rectangular, more stretched than iPhones. This makes their screen fit better with the cinema format of movies and therefore better suited for watching movies using the entire screen of the phone."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Apple custom services are only good if you buy the phone from apple , bought else where apple say no help sorry even for their latest phones plus in Europe every phone gets 2 years support by apple its a year which has caused apple many court cases , USB c is now on the latest phones thanks to europe"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"What about Security, virus 🦠 Android phone runs any apps. Every phone beside iPhone use android makes it difficult to use because if u use android on Samsung it will be different on LG or google. ios is the same for all the phones. iPhone have more hype better hardware, iPhone looks more prestigious iPhone technology have a luxury feel to it. I know I’m bias but iPhone has better value"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Apple quoted you on the last event come on man you know Apple is just better quality.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I can guarantee less than one percent of users are side loading apps or repairing their own phones. Totally understandable to leave these topics out of the conversation.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I would add an accessories category which iOS wins hands down. Everyone with an android either goes naked or has some janky case
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"No bloatware on an iphone is bs. Any apple software would be bloatware that I won't be using, and I can't delete, try picking a different app for your sms texting than imessage.
Apps goes to Android, sorry but, try sideloading an apk to an iphone.
Echosystem also goes to Android because it frees you from that jail imprisoning shit apple calls echosystem (buy all my shit or get out).
Ease of use is a tie. Androids don't force you to customize and without messing around with those things is the same easy experience.
The only benefit you get from an iphone is to stop being bullied by people that own those devices in US and try to facetime or send you imessage when you have an android. I will give you this, smaller product variety does give an easy life to developers, sad for consumers though.
At least Macs do have an advantage over everyobody else thanks to the efficiency of the ARM arquitecture.
Iphones are great for the people who's main use of their phone is basic things like social media scrolling."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Non-existent file management on iPhones was enough to make me change to android, and I was so happy about it! 
You didn't mention the fact that you can add a memory card to your android to have extended memory."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Your excitement category is based on your personal excitement Marques
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,What about cameras? Probably iPhone Ngl
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android is far better in every category & Apple is for idiots with lot of money to waste or have superiority complex..lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Yh Phone Vs Operating System,😩"

Well done tho, love the vids!"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apples ecosystem ...I dont care android what they have ...with windows they can't never work
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"3:40 My android has had focus mode, work mode, and do not disturb mode since launch...."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Life was MUCH better without smartphones. None of you will ever know.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"This always will be an endless debate due to the fact that it's highly subjective. Like at 15:59 I personally feel that android-based phones top Apple in every category except *MAYBE*  updates. That depends on the maker of the phone, as there's so many compared to just 1 Apple. 

Ease of use for me is hands down the absolute most important factor of any phone. To me, Android is so much easier, and quicker to use than Apple. I've got an Apple iPhone that I have to use for work for over a year now, and I absolutely hate that thing. HATE IT.  It's clunky, not smooth, and I always have to take the few extra steps to open an operating app vs an android. This really sucks because I have to use my phone quickly for work. 
I think the ecosystem for Android is more vast than Apple. Especially since there's so many companies pushing out products. 
I could care less about a smartphone watch, and really don't see the point in one."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,They should add an option in the settings to choose from basic user to advanced user. The advanced user should be given all those custom settings that android has and the basic users should have stock ios features for more easy use. They would sell a lot more phones if they did this.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Apple is a sweatshop! Cannot support this company.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Apple = Prestige,  Android = Innovation 💡,  Prestige trumps Innovation,  yep Apple strong only really in the 🇺🇸"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iPhone phone (physical) android software all day! Ok google is light years ahead of Siri.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"There’s one issue with the ecosystem argument for Android, and that is its ecosystems are accessible from iOS as well. The ecosystems aren’t Android exclusives. So it really isn’t close at all.

There’s also an issue with the features category, which is that you combine all the features from all android phones as 1. But unlike you normal people can only buy 1 phone, and when it comes to features in a single phone, iPhones are usually head to head with Android."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Lol how is iPhone better in the app category? You said it was because app development is easier/faster? So it's better for software engineers? What about the overall user experience? SMH
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Thank you

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I joke around about this a lot because I am a major fan of Apple.  But to be honest, as you point out, it's what WE use as individuals and is a very personal decision.  Whatever you like and enjoy and works for you is the winner."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The fact that one brand is compared to everyting else, says enough right?"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Great! But what about Google vs Samsung....

A mention my Tim Cook himself.. superb"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Customization is a hit or miss with android…

iphones are trash."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"While Apple doesn’t have as much customization, I do like how they have guidelines or bumpers to keep things looking consistent. With my Android, I can make it look however i want, but I’m no designer. Apple just makes it look clean without weird edge cases (IMO)."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"What? Iphone vs android??? What the hell is this title. Hardware vs Software, ain't no way??"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Ability to support my friends and family - definitely goes to the iPhone.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Honestly I'd say ease of use depends what you are trying to do. Trying to get to certain settings or do certain things on iPhones is mildly infuriating.

 A lot of stuff in settings is just needlessly buried, and the default browser experience is just utterly painful on iPhone if you want to navigate forward or back on webpages and even getting to other tabs is needlessly more complicated than it needs to be."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I think apple has paid him to win iphone updates and  ecosystem is more good of android than iPhone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I think you glossed over software updates a little too quickly and like many people completely missed something pretty big. Apple gets 5 major os updates and has that long term OS support yes, but OS updates mean way more for an iPhone than they do for an Android phone. On iOS the update from Apple updates EVERYTHING, including system apps and minor feature improvements like offline maps. Whereas with Android every app is updated via the play store, play services or apk completely independent from major OS updates. Which means Safari will stop getting updates in 5 years, but Chrome can work securely far longer than that since they typically target an API for an exceptionally long time. It’s an important distinction and it’s disappointing that you didn’t mention it at all. Because once 5 years are up on iOS updates, that’s it apart from major security patches. Whereas the vast majority of your Android apps will continue to receive updates far past 5 years, and the system can still get Play Services updates such as how nearby share rolled out to any phone running Android 8 or newer."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,It really depends on how techy you are. Android if you want to design your phone the way you like it. Apple if you want to follow the sheeple.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"As a developer who's worked on both platforms, there are a few issues here that stand out to me.  First is that these categories are all weighted the same, but they are not equal... it's called out in the end that it's going to be different for everyone, but there are some that are clearly far less important.  One of the largest missing categories is safety.  98% of mobile malware comes from the google play store... that's just insane.  As much as I hate Apple's walled garden, it's pros outweigh is cons, at least for most people.  Mobile Safari is an absolute pile of garbage and every browser you can get on the app store is just a lightly modified Safari (Apple won't allow anything else for security reasons).  Android allows some features that iOS refuses to that allows for some great functionality.  Like how a headless services (light background service that runs regardless of the state of the parent app) can stay running on Android, even when you restart the device (loss of battery, OS update, etc), where iOS forces the parent app to restart.  That's a big problem for a lot of iOS apps. 

As for why companies prioritize iOS apps, it's because people on that platform are more willing to spend money.  As much as dealing with all the different OS quirks of Android sucks, the people who make those decisions don't really care about that, they care about how they make their money and users on iOS are more willing to pay.  Though there are anecdotal situations where the opposite is true.

Also, The argument for the Samsung ecosystem is crazy, because it's extremely well known that you never buy anything from Samsung that isn't a TV or a phone, as their home appliances are some of the worst made."

For me I think most of these comparisons are not fair and always in favour of apple cause I use apple devices and I don't know how people come about these results.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,You're welcome
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Rating phone operating systems but completely ignoring privacy... yeah, sure. I mean it's just the one device with camera, microphone, permanent internet connection and all contacts as well as conversations with them you carry around the whole day. Why would privacy matter to that device, right?

But in my opinion any Linux phone takes the crown here, even if we ignore privacy.

- Customization: You can edit, modify, adjust everything... literally. Sure, Android theoretically offers the same options but then not most flavors of Android you get do that.
- Features: Anything a computer can do, can be done via Linux phone. If your hardware doesn't do it yet, hook the thing up which does via cable, wireless or solder it on your board - no problem.
- Ease of use: Yeah, that's a disaster depending on your distro (especially on phones), not gonna lie - next.
- Updates/support: It depends what you expect in terms of support... via phone at a company, unlikely - in a forum or wiki answering your questions and helping with niche details, definitely. Also you get lifetime updates. What's 4 or 5 years down the line in comparison to ""as long as there's a guy running a Debian server, you get your updates - no problem"" and even if that would end, swap out the distribution of Linux and continue. I'd expect that developers die before you are running out of updates.
- Apps: Everything on a Linux desktop works, many Android apps work, most Windows apps work and likely more. How well is it designed for mobile usage..? That depends on your expectations but it improves every day. I would say Android and iOS win that category for now.
- Excitement: Since a Linux phone is really different from anything we have seen in last 20 years, I would say it wins that easily. But I don't think it's an objective category either. But let's say it depends on the user.
- Ecosystem: You can run any app that runs on your Linux desktop on your phone and vice versa. You can develop your apps on desktop or mobile either way for all platforms. Apps in the stores are typically all FOSS (free and open-source software) which can actually be trusted with your data. Every optimization you can get, can be used the day it's published online if you want to. There's also no limitation when it comes to compatibility besides drivers. Even hardware which is not officially supported is likely to have a working driver built by the community around.

So the most issues you will have using a Linux phone is ""Ease of use"" and ""Apps"". Pretty important to most people but I would say it still wins within those categories. Definitely if you would add ""Privacy"" as another category. But then I would also argue those categories do not make a lot of sense to compare them as even. Obviously ""Ease of use"" and ""Apps"" matter much more to people than ""Updates/Support""... I mean, it's not even close."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I like these videos, however… 

1. Some features are too close to call e.g. features. Otherwise like customisation or ecosystem have a clear winner, therefore giving each a grade or point 1-5 would be better.
2. Ecosystem and updates go hand-in-hand. iOS vs android isn’t even a competition here, which is why google and Samsung change their flagship software every few years e.g. google hangout to google meets or Samsung having DeX which only works on some devices.
3. This video is for people who are 50/50. A lot of people like the features/excitement of an iPhone because apple positions itself as competing with itself and it’s previous models, not the competition. Whilst it’s not the way it should be, that’s how people still see it and therefore they’re more excited by the new iPhone vs the next Samsung.
4. These comparisons are always hard because you’re comparing a single choice iPhone (although there’s multiple iPhone variants) to multiple androids, or just Samsung or google. 
5. Finally, and most importantly, where is the category for sustainability? Which phone lasts longer? Which manufacturers older models do you see people using? Which is the easiest to repair (sadly this is a race to the bottom imo)?"

I would agree with Marques and say Android does have better customization, you can change the apps that come with the phones icon color like the call button, messaging, etc. A color pallet of the box type thing surrounding the app, the folders, and notifications . iphone just isnt that broad and has been kinding of lacking like how they just having these customization features recently."

Google creates devices so that they can deliver more ads, and slurp more personal information from you to sell."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The app preferences on IOS is what made me switch back to Apple. Despite having a better processor and customization every major app i used would crash constantly and never updated when I had my OnePlus 6T
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I agree with you but I add a category: ""selecting texts effortlessly"" game over for Apple ☠️☠️☠️"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Also if you dont get paid by these companies no need to champion them ive always used samsungs but f**k them too lol they a billion dollar company they dont need me to fight for them choose what you want
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"For the feature section, does android have shortcuts/automation like apple? If it doesn’t, apple is the clear winner for me"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,And i agree with iphone being easier to use im an android user but when people ask me i usually just say if you want to mess with your phone and do more with it choose samung but iphone just works lol all the cool features and stuff anyone can use it easily there's not much digging around
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Before i watch this i think hes going to say the real winner is YOU!
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I remember 2014 when I transported from Android to iPnone. It was a majestic experience. Everything just works without dancing with torches! Only iPhone since then.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Ease of use- yea. But only for US, rest of the world doesn t have problems with that, they understand basic phone control. 
Apple store are not everywhere !! Maybe in US, but in Europe and Asia ?!!!
.Last argument also, US is not he rest of the world...
 The world is bigger , and somehow that should win that argument. Although, for me, they are in a tie concerning ecosystem. 
Love the vids !!"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Of coz this comparison is biased towards iPhone. There are so many ways Android is way better than iOS; just depends on the user perspective and the things that matter to them.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I think a good category to add is UI. The fact that iphone does not have a universal back button is absolute ass. Furthermore, Android's back button also works on both the left and right side of the screen making it ambidextrous."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Wait, at 3:40 when you talk about features that iphone has that Android doesn't you mention focus mode. But the PIxel series does have a focus mode under the Digital Wellbeing category in the settings. And as far as deciding which contacts can interrupt you, that is lopped under do not disturb."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Apple is basically let's build the perfect phone + experience for everybody. Android is like let's build different phones, different experience so each person can choose their own. This is the main reason I have always been recommending android to friends and family, because I want them only to pay for features and experience they care about and not get locked into a specific mobile experience,, I have also recommended iPhones for types of friends who post on social media all the time and need a decent enough phone which will most likely not brake, these kind of people have a lifestyle that depends on the phone and therefore the iPhone fits in perfectly. iPhone or apple products in general are the safest recommendations you can give, so if you don't know or care about the tech or don't know about the needs and wants apple is always the safe choice"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android all the way🩷
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Personally, I think that Apple, for a long time, was indeed very innovative and out of the box. I mean, Donald Norman, working at Apple, conceptualized what we know as User Experience. But in the last few years, Apple mostly followed the path that other companies paved, taking almost zero risks in testing new markets or technical advancements. Just like Marques said, think about all the new attempts at folding devices that we are getting from Samsung, all the efforts to create high-quality VR devices and experiences from VIVE and Meta. To get a device like the Vision Pro for that price in 2023, it's expected that it should be that good, but it's by no means 'new'. In many ways, I think Apple is straying away from the path of innovation, especially when most of the significant design changes that people actually need are driven by new laws and demands coming from governments like the EU. I just saw a TikTok from this girl saying that Apple was genius to feature Type-C on their upcoming devices, like that was a totally intentional move..."

Why tf should I put your 7 categories in order and rate them?? I’m sorry but that whole bit is just stupid. You really didn’t think things through. Probably less than 1% of your viewers will actually watch this before deciding what phone to buy. Unless you’re 60+ years old, you already know your preference."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why android doesnt have the app drawer anymore?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I only disagree on the Updates topic, I believe android has many updates for many different devices and if your actual phone doesn't support it you can just buy an intermediate phone that can update or it comes with the new version of Android, unlike Iphones where you are obligated to buy the most recent device if your old Iphone doesn't support it anymore, and in my country they are really expensive."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I used both android and iphone and i will tell which is better each category in my opinion:

Hardware: iPhone - without a doubt iphone has the best cpu and gpu in the market. You'll never get lags when you gaming. Android is also great as well but in this category, iphone is still dominating.

Software: Android - You can do a lot of customization. You can edit everything from home screen, lock screen, keyboards, etc. 

Camera: I'd say both are debatable, When it comes to quality of taking pictures, iphone is better but also samsung is also getting better while they have the zoom thingy that you can take a picture of a moon. I'd say both on this category.

Battery and Charging: Android - Many Android Phones have much longer battery life plus many many brands such as Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo, OnePlus, etc have fast charging feature which is amazing.
 
Durability: iPhone - well they have thick design while many Android phones have slimmer design which means if they dropped well it's either hit or miss. 

Water/dust resistant: Both

Software updates: iPhone - you get updates like every 2 or 3 weeks.

Final conclusion: If you want just a simple and easy phone to use, get an iphone. If you like to do a lot of things such as customization and features, definitely get an android. They are both great phones in their own ways and category."

What they love about Apple is that everything Apple talks to everything Apple.  The Mac talks to the iPhone which talks to the iPad, etc.  So, when looking for a phone, first thing to consider is what other devices do you use.  That's where I place the greatest weight."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me is apples exosystem a big fat minus point for apple - because this is their way to extort you for their overprized hardware
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I would disagree with the ""ease of use"", it is definitely Apple marketing.  But if you take an android phone out of the box and do nothing to it, it works like an iPhone, my 84 year old mother had no problems,  but updates and support, Apple is way ahead.  The Pixel gets 4 years only."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Not in the above category but one major thing for me is the price which Android wins. The flagships may have similar price (I dont know) but in low-end to midrange, Android has more choices. I live in the 3rd world country so price is one of the key deciding factor. Thus, it's android for me. If Apple releases a phone similarly specced and priced as those midranged Xiaomi phones, I might just give it a try. But we all know Apple wont go that low."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"You missed the most important category, the durability. Apple products are way more durable than androids."

My mom asks me if i got a new phone everytime i do it lol. I love the simple fact that its done my way not the ""apple way"" as you mentioned."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Interesting that Apple won the ecosystem category but that ecosystem only works if there's multiple users inside that ecosystem.

This is just a personal preference and has got nothing to do with IOS being poor or anything. They both have their share of merits and you can't go wrong with either.

Taking outside of context or a specific user. As you explained at the end of your video. If you are someone that just wants to use a phone for send some messages, call and maybe send a picture over whatsapp. You are fine with a 150 euro android phone. Which is new. An iphone would just be way overpriced, old and used. It also greatly depends on what apps you want to use. I really like pokemon games. I own many different gameboy, gba and ds games as hard copies but don`t want to drag the hardware with me. I would therefor never want an iphone since I cannot play those games on it. Via regular apps and without jailbreaking. In fact I think that for almost anyone an android is a better choice in which you scale the price. But if everyone around you has an iphone, it can be easier to also own an iphone. Same goes if you own a mac already. It just intergrates better together. There is not set answer to this question."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Hello MKBHD.  Good comparison video between the two phone operating systems Android and iOS.  Generally speaking, all this comes down to personal preference for either side.  I'm an Android user and my choice would be Android.  In addition to what was mentioned in this video about customization and features on the Android side, another advantage for Android is there are more phone devices to choose from.  If you want a regular smartphone, mid-range phone or foldable phone, Android has those.  Also, Android has faster wired battery charging and has wireless charging.  As for mobile payment systems, the advantage is Android.  Samsung Pay now being known as Samsung Wallet and Google Pay now being known as Google Wallet, both mobile payment systems gets accepted at more locations than Apple Wallet (formerly known as Apply Pay).  

If I were to make a comparison video between these two phone operating systems, I would include two more categories besides the seven mentioned in the video.  In total, it'll be nine.  

Category # 8 - Devices To Choose From

People decide on which phone to get based on the availability for devices to choose from.  Same thing with automobiles and other major things people buy.  

Category # 9- Mobile Payment Systems 

As we all know digital payments being made for in person purchases has been on the rise.  Each year that comes by more and more people are putting it into effect.  Instead of getting involved in a wrestling or boxing match trying to find cash or debit card/credit card, people just grab out their phones from their pockets or purse and just pay that way for whichever items they want to buy.  So, between Samsung Wallet, Google Wallet and Apple Wallet, which one of those would be better?  Well, my phone is a Samsung phone so as for me I'm going with Samsung Wallet.  Due to overall flexibility, if I want I can activate Google Wallet, but I'm not going to do that."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"We should also consider the security. We use so many Mobile Banking application nowaday. In my country, so many people got hacked and drained money from their accounts. 100% of victims got hacked via android phone. It's not the phone false. Hacker uses social enginering to fool the victims to enable app installation from outside Google play store, fool victim to go to the fake Google play store and install app that share screen, give remote control, register to fake app and create new PIN ID which normally will be the same as PIN ID that we use in other apps, etc. Anyway, it can be done because Android allow that. With this, I have trust issue with android. 

And also from Bloatware that cannot be deleted. Some even come with Ad and auto update. And each phone try to force us to use thier own App Stores and cloud services. We will be asked to create Samsung ID, Oppo ID, Xiaomi ID and so on. Changing phone form one brand to another is so annoying in Android world. In my dad phone, even I blocked app installation, it is got so many Bloatwares update and Ads. Now he can no longer access the phone setting to delete those apps because there will be Ads after Ads after Ads. 

iPhone also got something similar to Bloatware; Garage Band, iTuneU,  Tips, TV, etc. that I don't use. But I still feel save because it just be there and not cause any issue. While storage cleaner, battery saver, Voice Control app and many more in Android always come with Ad and keep pop up again and again even I already disable them."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"It all boils down to what type of person you are. If your a person who likes to live in a box, and doesn't like options,  and don't take the time to learn anything then iPhone is for you."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"One of the big features why I love iphones is the way you switch from old iphone to new one. All of the photos, apps, contacts, notes, settings, etc carry over seamlessly to the new device. Even every app you had will be installed on the same exact spots they were on. You don't have to worry about missing anything. It will be all there. It saves so much time and work it's amazing."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,slow day ...
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Side-loading is SUCH an important aspect of owning an Android phone that it just cant make me switch to Iphone. You didn't even considered mentioning it at all!
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Hey bro i am from bangladesh❤
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Where’s is security in your category?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I would argue with ""Ecosystem"" category, just because it's harder to control specific things and how they behave. It's more like everything or nothing"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I think MBHD wanted a fat paycheck so he made the most milktoast video ever.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Can't you just run a dual boot OS? They both have same physical UI & sensors
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Bro forgot about budget.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"If you replace Ecosystem with Gatekeeping, it is not a positive point for apple"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"For me, a good apps should be able to communicate with other devices and other brands, not lock me in one ecosystem."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Its so shocking  that only 3 things can  make a difference of a Lifetime 😅
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Why people say iPhone vs Android instead of iOS vs Android?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Bang for buck. Contest over.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Man... I would happily pay a subscription service to apple to have iMessage on Android, just to get my friends to stop complaining"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The iPhone ecosystem is top tier—let’s be honest.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I liked the way you described “Ease of use” part 😊 which is the reality as majority of people are not tech enthusiast and prefer to stay intact with the same set of designs and use. 

As I use both the devices widely, Would like to add further that Android wins in ease of use even for tech enthusiastic people as they blend smoothly with windows/Linux or any other hardware, whereas there are hell lot of restrictions and challenges when someone use iPhone with a windows or Linux as they pushes you to build up the entire set of devices to apple ecosystem. Hope  “Ease of use” works for this too 😊

Also a drawback for Android “Ease of use” is that due to wide variety of devices & brands and different software agreements with each one, it’s hell lot fragmented and there is a challenge of software-hardware sync match. This never happens with ios and iPhones which definitely the major USP for apple devices."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"There is ONE single feature i use multiple times a day on my phone and no matter how hard I want to switch to the iPhone, I cant. That is clipboard, allows me to copy many things and paste them selectively as I wish. On Android it is seamless."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I went to apple because google is getting way to intrusive. They want all your data.  All your internal memory so you have to buy google storage. It's ridiculous
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Samsung system data is 90 GB. So out of 256 you get 166gb of memory... That is non removable apps. Apple at least uses only 15 to 20gb for system data that is unremovable. My s22 was half full just from stock installed apps that I am not allowed to remove.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I switched to iPhone a long time ago because I'm tired of customizing my Android phone to look like iPhone iOS.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Ending was cheese MK.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"""Put the pitchforks down""... LOL... 😂"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,There are way more MORE FREE Apps on Android with a full version features compared to Apple!...

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Well good for consumer now......but watching teens tribalise over a messaging service and the knock on sociological issues that come with that and the parents/ care takers who are expected to take that financial burden for their child's well being...well time for the channel to start growing up and embedding those things in to the review process, no??

 Not to mention a matured product on the either side of the ecosystem needs to start kicking in to clean up the massive e-waste mess that has accumulated since this all kicked off in 2007. You're growns up now, start cleaning things up for the next generation and be happy we have some amazing interaction capability.

That is you the review ecosystem I'm speaking too, needs to grow up from entertainment factor to engaging in other social qualities."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,resubscribed ;)
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The biggest Elephant in the room that wasn't on your list as a standalone category is [Security] ... iphone's Security updates supercedes ALL other categories. Customization be damned! Protect my phone from malicious actors, I'll live without a specific hardware interface or a 10x camera 🙄"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The reality is, it's Apple vs Samsung. The only good version of Android is Samsungs One UI version and that really is the best iOS/Android comparison. People with iphones hate Android because they're used to seeing the other shitty versions of Android."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I'm a little older than Gen Z so I haven't really had any issues with getting ""green bubble shamed"" but a lot of the features I use in Android that make my life easier really aren't available on iOS. Since I'm a PhD student I need to manage a lot of files and iOS' clunky approach to file management is pretty annoying when on my android I can basically just use it as a portable hard drive. I might not get air drop but that's really not that big of a deal for me personally."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,This is a brilliant video ❤
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Great video but where's security?

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,first 2 android the rest  iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you establish android to be daring and able to try all why would i care that they try new things im more exited for iphones
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android is ALWAYS about Customization. That already and automatically means that it wins in Features and Excitement as well.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Great job 👏🏿
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,If you really want to know the difference between ecosystem. By an Android phone and iphone. Then buy another product of PC. Then connect the your phone to the pc let see the one that works. Then you can actually chose your ecosystem from there..  i guess u can't connect your apple watch with android watch..  who has ever send or receive file by using Bluetooth on iphone?? Lemme see your hands up
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The last time that an Android phone was actually competing with iPhone was pixel 2xl. Then come to find out that the battery was junk so the phone wouldnt last more than 2 years. The hardware of an iPhone is unmatched by android. My jailbroken iphone 12 pro max, even being on ios 14 is still more stable than my pixel 7 work phone or any samsung I've had before that on their current software versions. The dynamic island is a gimmick and people ate it up so no I'm not just an apple fan boy. Simply put, nobody on the android side has made anything to really compete with the experience I continue to have with my jailbroken iphone 12 PM."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I bought iPhone and ditched after 6 months, I find it lacks so many basic functionality which my android was having for years."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I just recently switched to iPhone just because of the crash detection and satellite emergency messaging.  My BIGGEST complaint with Apple is that I can't customize the home screen.  For crying out loud Apple let me customize the home screen the way I want, not the way you want."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Danny Duncan should watch this

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Ease of use should have included accessibility as a bullet point. Changing font/icon sizes etc would be key points for the older folks out there.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Updates/Support: You definitely overlooked Fairphone here.. ^^'
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Where does battery life fall in in this system? Features? Ease of use? Apps or customization given Android's ability to switch between screen refresh rates?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,There's focus mode on my Xiaomi mobile
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"""Apple Ecosystem"" is the dumbest thing ever created by Apple and his defenders. They are just trying to hold you in, blocking your Iphone or making it difficult to connect to non Apple devices.
The Android IS an ecosystem. All android devices are compatible, all android devices can share or connect in some way. 
I can use my Samsung smartwatch, my Pixel phone, my JBL earphones, my Xiaomi tablet and all of them can be connected to my PC, my laptop or any other PC.  
Android is an open world full of possibilities, we are not locked inside a brand, we can choose what we want and what we like.
The Android has the same apps and features but they are not locked, we can use them on Android, Windows or Linux ^^"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Great video I really enjoyed it.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Only young enthusiasts; like Android.    We mature adults like reliability which Android phones often lack.   I left Android because my Samsung 6 Edge Plus was defective, the replacement was defective in the same way.    The second replacement, all from Samsung had a defective battery.   It was out of warranty.    As a result, I bought an iPhone.  iPhones work.   From the 8 to the 14 I have never had a problem.  By the way, my Samsung watch was defective.   Samsung tablets are poor.  You don't keep a device long enough to test reliability which is a glaring omission in your category."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I just love the Apple iPhone user interface. First Android I ever had with the great mini Tablet Nexus 7. Liked it a lot but I was so much happier when I switched to my first Apple, an Air 2. It was like I had used it for years. My business is all Apple with a little PC here and there. It’s ease of use for me; means I’m never going to care how great Android gets."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I would give ease of use to Android. Because you basically said that if you want a phone that stays basic and doesn't change....Use iphone lol. That sounded like a negative to me. And then it's also a huge red flag that you are confirming that they keep their phone the same, but raise prices continuously every year with no changes 

For updates and support you didn't give a good reason. I literally get updates like every month for my android phones. And what iphone user still has their phone from 2018? Hell who keeps a phone past 2-3 years (in the majority)?? So not sure about that category. But maybe that category is just a tie at this point because I'm not familiar with iphones updates. Although I've heard plenty of people claim that phones slow down around new releases to force them to buy a new phone?

I also wish you added in the camera. Because that's a lot of iphone users excuse, while they are not photographers and just use the simple Auto mode. I've seen so many videos (some from you) where Android flagships, beat iphones

I would also say that the buzz of the iphone ecosystem here in the US is actually extremely toxic and cult like. People will bully you for not having an iphone. Girls will choose to not date you for not having an iphone. I had a friend tell me I should get an iphone because she doesn't like my green bubbles LMFAOOOOOO. Like I don't think I would give iphone a point for that type of behavior tbh. Iphone has SINGAL HANDEDLY created a judgmental environment when it comes to phones. Even just all apple products. Someone tried to clown me because I didn't have a macbook. All the while I have an Asus Zenbook Pro with two screens and not some little bar the macbook had"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Whether your 8 or 80 both know how to use an iPhone :P
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I’m an apple user, ease of use I will give android. First time Android is more about common sense, the first time apple needs to learn."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android is far superior
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Get and apple and you never going to eat it. You don't own the device that you pay for. Apple owns it and you pay top $$ for Rent.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,For consumers to be winners there needs to be more than two competing companies (IOS vs Android). Phone market is mature and into the 'oligopolic stage.' At this stage consumers get products that do not have replaceable batteries and have a predetermined (short) useful life.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"If you compare the functioning of apps between iOS and Android , I go more often to set stuff in android and go back to iPad. So what makes iOs apps better? Or all apps on iPad more inferior than on an iPhone. The last question I can’t answer."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Nah. This is the best I've seen. Still an android tho
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Apple ecosystem, software stability, software updates and ease of use are the only things iOS win over Android. Other than that, Android is better BUT Android hardware kind of mixed-bag when considering Chinese phones (Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo etc.) have their own accessories and ecosystem that is not working as intended when pairing with other phone/accessories from other brands even though these devices running on the same OS.

The price of apps and subscriptions, and also web shots detecting your OS and adjusting the price accordingly. Personally - I have both phones, iphone and pixel, but tend to use the iphone more because of user friendliness and seemingless"

1. Apple mobiles and accessories costly than Android
2. Android is easy to use because of customisation as per once preference 
3. As for app you side load many apps which are not in play store
4. Generally people buy or change phone after 2-3 yrs of usage, for better and latest hardware. Is there point in long term updates
5. In Android phone has varities of accessories at various price for various users whereas Apple product are costly to repair and to replace them"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"One thing that makes me regret my Android to iphone switch is no work profile support on iOS. How can that be missing in current day and age? 

Also not naming iMessage a gatekeeper in EU seems kind of strange to me as I switched to iphone especially due to the fact my closest family uses iphones and it was ""too much"" for them to rich text with me with other 3rd party apps."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,How is this the final verdict?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"My problem is that with Android your experience wildly differs. I am on a Pixel 7 Pro right now so I am getting both the latest and greatest updates and the cleanest version of Android. This is not the case with large parts of the Android world. I am for example not a fan of the way Samsung changes Android. Some of the changes can be undone (e.g. by installing a launcher) but some can't. Many cool features (e.g. the magic eraser) are pixel only right now. This is where iOS is better. If you do go for Android because of this video, keep in mind that many things that were named here only apply to Pixel phones. They're great, but if you go for something like an OPPO Phone, you won't get these things."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"now no one can say that they have ""upgraded"" from android to ios...it does not make sense."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Let’s be honest, for the time being we’ve never had it so good. If you’re able to treat yourself to a higher end smart phone, you can’t make the wrong choice. They’re all exceptional, regardless of manufacturer.
Thanks for the video pal."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I wish you have talked about international support, because iPhone is every where and the 5g work in most of the word like if you travel a lot,  but some Android phones not available in many countries and if you bay it from outside you well have issue with connectivity 5g ,  that made me switch to iPhone after 10 years of being Android user (google Phones). thanks"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The best solution is to jave both. For daily use I prefer iOS and for some special moments I use Android.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Having been an Android guy since the inception isAndroid while using an iPad because it's simply better than any Android tablet IMO i have to disagree about iOS winning in the apps category for two reasons.

1.) There are MANY iOS applications which do not work on the iPad correctly and display on phone mode.

2.) Having the ability on Android to sideload applications is so very important for many reasons i won't go into here.

That said i will give the nod to iOS application quality for some of the apps I use, they seem to be better optimized for iOS."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"iOS easy to use? I used the Google search to find out so many things. Why is the camera settings in the system settings and not in the camera app? how to just disable the ""call missed"" sound like on Android? ..."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I think the video is very biased to ios.
If we talk about Ease of Use, definitely the android is much easier to use because here we can do the customisation according to our need.
2. In terms of Apps, android is unbeatable. If we consider these POV:-
Developer: Developing android app is much easier than ios
Business: because of android’s open platform it is very simple to list the app on playstore for any business.
User experience: Apps work much better in android than the ios and also The point you made, updates are coming to ios first is totally wrong. I never see this thing. Every time update first come to android.

3. Ecosystem:- I think you haven’t tried the ecosystem for MI. Just try once the opinion will change for sure 😊"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Yes!!! Team iPhone wins again.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Cmon Marques.
You literally can't say that Apple is genuinely easier to use over android.
I guess in the Echo Chamber that is Apple Ecosystem in the US led to this conclusion.
But Apple's ease of use IS horrible, HORRIBLE, to anyone who has never used an iPhone or iPad before.
Here's a challenge.
Take an android tablet and an iPad to middle aged users who've never used tablets before. And see who can get setup and going faster with the basics... Mail, YouTube, Netflix etc. 
Then, take an android phone to an iPhone user and an iPhone to an android user, and see who can get running faster.
Lastly, you forgot the 2 most important criteral :
1. Cost of ownership and Price...
2. Reparability.
Apple's a cult, android is an ecosystem.
And a dying cult at that.
Apple revenues have been going down for past 2 years, while Google's have reversed the losses and going up."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I love iDevice updates because they make my device better by forcing me to buy a new one. Not an issue I've had on my S20FE 5G

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,You made a lil error focus mode is on android under digital well-being
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Just a quick point on apps, you’ve made very good points, but one bit that I think a lot of people miss, is that older versions of android still support newer versions of apps. I’ve got an iPad mini 2 from a million years ago, but basically none of the apps on the App Store can be installed on it, meanwhile my OnePlus 3 has been out of date for at least 3 years and still gets every app update and can use the entire App Store suite of apps, minus a few. That’s a huge draw imo.

Also I don’t think ecosystems is really that close. Google’s ecosystem is cross platform, so apple gets all that compatibility and I don’t really think Samsung’s ecosystem is that comparable to apple’s. I hate apple’s walled garden and ecosystem restrictions, so I hate that ecosystem, but credit where credit is due, they’ve done a very good job with it"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,There is a category that Android wins easily: price
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Apple stores so rare in Lithuania, some even get closed. And we in Europe. I'm afraid to buy iPhone also because it's impossible to repair and also after buying 1500€ smartphone I also would need to buy separately a new charger for around 50€ from 3th party. Dot know aple prices. And usually with android phones in Lithuania u would get smart  watches or wireless headphones,  mostly with Samsung. So no point in buying Apple"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Customization and file management will forever be what keeps me on Android, given I doubt Apple will budge on either of those things. I like having the ability to whatever i want with my phone way too much."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The problem with his take on android features is they are not OS features.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I feel like customization and features are to similar to be two separate categories
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I appreciate the objectivity; it is very much a personal preference thing.  A couple of points I wanted to add is that app variety and cost should be considered.  There have been multiple occasions where I've told my friends about a cool app that was free on Android that costs money on Apple. It's almost like shopping on Amazon and at Walmart compared to stores at the local mall.  Android wins on flexibility and cost. The second point is the cost in general (hardware and accessories).  Apple has made inroads in affordability, but Android has so many options and continues to be the leader in options for everyone's budget."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Correction, it is Android OS versus iOS or better said open source Linux versus lockdown freebsd."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I think for ecosystem it would have been interesting to mention that android is made by Google and thus receives some integration benefits with the Google ecosystem.

Granted not a very common application like turning my Android phone into a PC loud speaker, or play bit-perfect audio via the USB-C port. But those 2 are 2 functionalities I use every single day with my good ol' Galaxy S10.

I'd say for someone who uses their phone purely as a phone, the iPhone is the way to go. For anyone who wants more functionalities out of their phone, iPhone isn't gonna cut it and you'll find so many good things on Android that makes your life much better."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"A lot of people mentioned sideloading on Android, which is true, but I would also like to point out the very America-centric view of the mobile OS divide in this video. In Europe, you can't prioritize iOS over Android in app development. In fact, push comes to shove, and you would have to entirely give up on one of them, it would make more sense to drop the iOS app then the Android app, since the Android market is much larger and dropping the Android one would effectively mean the death of your app.

I now in the US it's the other way around, but the US isn't the whole world."

Also you are comparing exclusive Samsung stuff to Apple but that doesn’t make sense in an Android against iOS video"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Thanks for this video. You made me realize every reason to use an iOS is as shitty as my poop from yesterday. I found iPhones to be boring and overpriced. It's dumb to compare $300 phone to a $1000 phone and then distributing points. You can literally get 4 Androids at the price of one iPhone and they all work flawlessly.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I'm very close to switching from Android to Apple because I'm really fed up with the Ecosystem on Android. Also the amount of thought Google puts into their flagship devices (e.g. Pixel Watch) is underwhelming
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Good to know Apple finally got rid of the bloatware. Couldn't hide or delete apps, so I'd end up putting them in a folder called CrApp. Used to be 9+ Apple-branded things that clogged up the look/feel/memory, even if only slightly. I think a major factor for me is also price. For most of the past decade, I could get a OnePlus with all or almost-all of the features of a flagship iPhone/Samsung for a third of the price. Even if I loved Apple, I also need that money for other things - so it was never going to win while their phones cost upwards of $1700CAD, in many cases!"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"It is impossible to choose one. each is different, Android phones are more affordable than iPhones and that's the only difference. Of course I am not talking about flagships which are overpriced on both sides. You can buy a mid range Android phone while for the same price you will get a 3 years old iPhone. The Apple ecosystem is where people lose a lot of money due to the way they built the system."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I really want to buy a Fold5… but my main issue is that everyone I know, family and friends, use an iPhone. Meaning I would be left out on iMessage, FaceTime and such features… 

Second, the ecosystem is also important to note here for me, as said in the video… I use a Mac for work, a Mac on a private basis, an iPad, Apple TV and sometimes I also wear my Apple Watch for exercise (I have a Grand Seiko for daily driver). This means that the Samsung would not play ball with all my other devices thanks to Apple. I would have to either live without those benefits of continuity, hand-off, typing in stuff from the phone on the Apple TV and so on.. and I am not sure I am able to give that up because it gives me such ease of use in my daily life, saving me so much time.."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"i v changed to iphone 14 while i m still having the Galaxy S22. and i can confirm that the Galaxy is much pleasing to use, to hold and customise. the only part that i m happy with for the Iphone is the battery life and (not so much) the camera."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I feel like as a former Android user (I switched just because I wanted to try the iPhone,nothing against my phone) one of the key features of iPhones is longevity. Even higher end Android phones seem to start developing issues, slowing down, etc. iPhones appear to be much more future proof, and you can rock a 3-4 yr old iphone and it will still work relatively well. 

The next feature is of course the ecosystem, once you and your friend start using iPhones it is easy to see why it is hard to lock you in. iPhones are a stealth social network. The way they integrate with the rest of the Apple products is also second to none. I am going to assume, if I ever can justify buying something to replace my Sony XM3s, is that the bluetooth pairing will work far more seamlessly with AirPod/w.e that headset is called. It is a minor quibble, but a quibble nonetheless. 

Finally, there is just the feel. iPhones just feel more premium. I don't know how to explain it, but holding an iPhone just feels more premium."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I'd like to add one more category. Budget smartphone. Not everyone can afford a high end smartphone. Plus if the iPhone is let's the XR it's still pretty costly like around 25k-30k which is weird given how that phone released 5 years ago. Most people like budget phones to be connected and because of that Android ecosystem. You talked about Samsung ecosystem but the video is titled Android. Samsung things work with it's devices but alot of things can work with a non Samsung device which are an Android basic device. 3rd you can choose a budget smartphone in Android and you can tweek and search the specifications and features you need. I want clean Android with a finger print, fast charging and in budget, I went with the Motorola and there are many other companies which have this Android and can provide it. 4th Apple released the SE series but the cost is still high. Where as Samsung Motorola oppo vivo Xiaomi real mi are giving good phones with a very budget friendly phone."

Would love to see a deeper dive into your process and setup; recently LTT came out with a video on their ""live-compositing"" greenscreen hardware for the Gamelinked channel, but even the color correction there and the masking actually leaves a bit to be desired. Don't get me wrong, they are better than 99% of even blockbuster masking, but that's the problem with greenscreens, even the best isn't good enough to look REALLY real.

I can understand with all the supposed tech geeks who appreciate things like customization and refresh rates but in all honesty most people don’t care about stuff like that at least in my case.

I’m never going to switch back based on my horrible experiences I had with Samsung . I’ve been a Apple fan girl for a very long time (8 years) and I don’t plan on changing that anytime soon. Those that like android that’s OK it’s your personal preference android is just not my cup of tea. When I used to use Samsung I had nothing but problems after problems it was either the camera, overheating, battery/charging port etc, or the connection to the cellular data.Sometimes it was everything in between.When I switched to iPhone I had 98% less problems than when I was with Samsung so I decided to never turn back. But I guess in the end it gets down to everyone’s personal preference I will never knock what people like. I just know that in my own personal experience I did not have a great experience with Samsung anytime I had any of their products. And in all honesty, if somebody asked me if I would recommend Samsung, my answer would be a hard no, but I would give them my honest opinion but also tell them that they need to make the decision on their own . We are all not made out of cookie cutters. We all have our own personal preference of what we like but I can only make suggestions..

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Short answer for me is, if you have specific tastes and expectations from a phone you probably like Android. If you want something that just works and is a ""good phone"" non-specifically you probably like ios"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"8:00 you are missing the fact that you can NOT backup apps on an iPhone anymore, while you can even sideload on an Android. With Apple you need to be OK with hoping Apple or the developer does not pull their stuff from the app store, because if they do, your purchase is just gone. You can not install an older OS on an iPhone and though 5 years seems like a lot, many of the updates since iPhone 10 will break compatibility with the ecosystem if you don't keep everything to the latest version. Updating an older Apple watch requires wiping and reinstalling. Updating Mac OS has caused purchased apps to stop working multiple times.
You might call the category ""freedom"" or ""the device you bought with your cash is yours to use as you wish"". You pay for ease of use and lack of features with Apple by being forced to keep replacing hardware that still works as intended."

Like an actual filesystem, so many apps on iPhone leave their data behind even if you delete them. That is not acceptable. Also the fact that iPhones screens dim if the device gets a little hot, how is that acceptable with such a great CPU? And let's not even talk about the fragile glass back panel that is glued so strongly that you have to use a laser to repair it. No thanks."

I have had several Apple products, and with every iOS update, the product became slower, to the point of unusability. I learned to turn the auto-updates off on any Apple products. I have not had an Android phone so I cannot comment on them.

Yes there are lots of apple store but the support they provide is terrible. 4 out 5 times they will push you to just throw away your device for a new one or charge an insane price for the support/repair.
Google specifically for me has the best support I've ever seen. For technical support you can literally just go to your settings and get connected in 2min to someone at Google that will guide you to fix your problem. And for the only time I've ever had to get a phone fixed it took 3 emails total all on the same day and they shipped me a new phone.
And for apps, theres the fact that the same apps are generally WAY cheaper on android and also that you can install apps from outside of the play store which is major."

Also using a windows laptop and whenever i need to transfer any files from my phone to my laptop its very easy. Heck I can even edit documents on my phone then send to my laptop if i need to work using a bigger screen v.v . Plus the 3rd party apps are way better for android  (if you know what i mean) 

I do have a macbook pro and for me its an overpriced and oversized paper weight. Cant run anything properly from the last 5 years especially on games. Hard to transfer files/convert to a more ""common"" application. Yes that ecosystem is a big factor and if you look at the bigger picture, IOS products runs seamless on things made by Apple. Android apps/ end products run easier on everything else even on IOS.

I own a Samsung Galaxy S8 tablet and I prefer it over a notepad anyday.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Thank you for putting this together. It's quite measured and well thought out. I will have to disagree with you about the ecosystem. Are there only 3 apps in Apple's ecosystem? What about Google's ecosystem of software -- gmail, google photos, gogole drive, even its notes app which you can share checklists etc with people. Google's messenger app uses the latest standard, RCS, and the major usability plus is that you CAN'T TELL who is messaging from iPhones vs other devices because they seamlessly bridge the gap that apple has made by trying to wall off their functionality. It's just been my experience. I hate that I have to buy an entire device to be part of the Apple iOS ecosystem when Google makes it seamless for users instead of making walls."

Currently on my Galaxy Note 10+ from 2019. For me, the pen, the customization, features, file management inside of android and multitasking with two apps at same time kept me happy on android.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Clearly, Clearly Android is big win. If you talk about eco system then Samsung is winner in android. I have seen so many blind fans (fanboys) who just stick with iPhone thinking it is status phone. They don't even know how to change some settings in phone and says I love Apple phone only. About app categories Marq said, I don't agree with him at this point. Because apple gives 1 or 2 devices in single year. They need to worry about less devices and their support, meanwhile android has huge dataset of devices to follow up, Clearly it need time to support all. That's not minus point in my point of view."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"These ""comparasions"" are so distorted by Apple's relentless promotion machine, it is almost comical. It all started when Apple had a single phone to offer for years and years in a row and everybody thought that was fine. Then, everybody bought the marketing of meh!-quality displays when compared to Amoled, just because Apple came up with cute name of ""Retina"". This also was OK for years and interactions in a row. Now, Samsung has foldable phones - FOLDABLE! - and everyone still thinks Apple has an edge in anything, when it comes to smartphones and tablets. One of these days, the Koolaid will be served and there will be a strong relief in the world's overpopulation problem, I guess..."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Thank you for finally breaking this down and explaining how it's really about what's most important to you and what features you want!
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"""Never any bloatware, ever on an iPhone"", I would argue that it's full of it, and it's all Apple bloatware. We just seem to dismiss it because it's not 3rd party bloatware."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The ""ecosystem"" argument is just stupid . I want to use a phone PERIOD no need to buy with it the whole apple overpriced products ."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"If I only count the features that matters for me, I am counting 2-0 to Android."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I think iPhones are for USA. Where else on earth is Facetime popular? Lol... people just use Whatsapp
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"In addition to this, I have a more principled objection to apple. I've been a computer tech for over 20 years and apple stuff is always WAY too expensive and a massive pain to fix. Using any iOS software (mobile or desktop) feels like walking through sandpaper. It's never smooth and never, not once, ""just works"". Apple hasn't innovated anything since 2012 (the lightning cable) and just rebrands things they ripped off from android or others. Combine that with the elitist bully culture apple has willingly and gleefully curated and I will refuse to ever use apple products just based on principle."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I find the Google Pixel very easy to use, everything is just laid out for convenience. The example of the iPhone layout being the same, will be easy if you're a previous iPhone user, but if you're not, it may not be easier."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I agree with everything except apps. Your ""average users"" wont notice the difference between ios or android version of apps, but allowing myself to grab an apk of basically any thing i want or need takes the cake anyday"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,No bloatware on the iphone? I remember when they installed apps and wouldn't let you uninstall them. That's bloatware in my mind.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Hello MKBHD, there are so many other criteria for comparison which you forgot to include, some which are more practical in consideration for this generation of consumers. Such as Security of device, affordability, bug fixes and customer service. I have come across people who absolutely love Apple and their devices for all the positives you highlighted in the video above, but end up using a mid-tier Android device since they can't afford an iPhone. Price is a real life determining factor for which side an average consumer would lean to. Majority of consumers do not understand the price to use a premium product, and they would be willing to settle for less. Not to mention middle class families, who would not even think of spending that amount of money on Apple devices, as they earn their daily bread just to get through the month. Any thoughts ?"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,What about SECURITY?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"One thing that is currently extremely annoying about iPhone is the amount of different chargers required when travelling. If you have an iPhone, iPad 6 mini, Air 4 or Pro (or greater in any of them) then you need a USB-C charge cable. The iPhone itself can use a magsafe charger or a lightning cable. Airpods can use a lightning cable. The Apple Watch needs its own separate charger. You could end up needing 4 separate cables depending on what you've got. On Android, it's one USB-C cable and you're set since you can reverse wireless charge your watch from your phone (and if not it's one more cable)."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"the only reason for me to buy an iPhone right now is AirDrop.
i mean, nothing in android comes close, heck not a single alternative even gets remotely close to how seamless AirDrop is between Apple devices.
i much prefer an Android Phone personally, but the amount of times a day i have to transfer pictures from my phone to my macbook makes it such a slow and annoying chore (i'm using corporate onedrive) that i just WANT to have access to AirDrop...
personally as i said before, if i had to buy a brand new phone today to replace my old trusty and reliable S10+, i would PREFER to get either the S23 Ultra, or any other comparable flagship android phone but with a microSD slot (its either i get Dex, or i get expandable storage lol)

but right now, it is really tempting for me to wait until the iPhone 16 comes out with that beautiful seamless notchless display i've always wanted (i actually was planning on getting the Mi MIX3 before i got my S10+, but locally it was only imported in its base model - which was 6GB RAM and 128GB non-expandable storage)
during my time with my S10+ i've learned that 128GB just isn't enough for me, neither is 256GB (i had 128GB SD card), now i'm using a 256GB Sandisk Extreme Pro SD Card + 128GB Internal storage.

so realistically that means if i am going to get an iPhone it'd have to be 512GB at least or even 1TB, or if it is a Samsung flagship it would have to be 512GB at least if not even 1TB.
the reason why i'm considering 1TB is because i know i am going to be using my next phone for a couple of years and i KNOW that i am almost certainly going to fill it with more than 512GB during that time.
if Samsung didn't go the Apple route and kept MicroSD card support in their phones than the choice would've been so much simpler, but since its basically ""Apples to Apples"" here there really is no significance of one over the other - except for AirDrop vs Dex - and i would pick AirDrop over Dex in a hindsight right now lol."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,He forgot about the price factor
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Make that ecosystem video please!
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The biggest issue I have with my iPhone 13 is the lack of any LED/indicator that I have unread notification without turning the screan on and the fact that the recent call history is insanely limited.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"4 years of security updates? You clearly live in the past. Samsung offers 4 years of os updates and 5 years of security updates nowadays. Also, it must be mentioned that even though the iPhone 10R will get the latest iOS version this year it won't get so many of the features announced because it's too old so it doesn't really matter"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Something interesting that you mention is the cultural aspect of what’s important. In the US iMessage and FaceTime are super big while in the EU WhatsApp is super huge so having an iPhone just for iMessage is not as much of a selling point.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"It's interesting, when I watched it, by the end, I said ""Oh yeah, Apple makes a 'better phone,' I've always known that. But it isn't the better phone FOR ME. I don't care about apps, ease of use, ecosystem, or updates. I barely actually USE my phone so I want customization and flexibility. Plus, I can get a used OnePlus flagship for like 500 bucks, and even used Apple devices can run twice that..."" I think you did miss a couple categories though. Namely, durability, security, and reliability. It's obvious why those weren't picked, Android runs the full gamut on that, but those are more important to many than ""ecosystem"" and so on."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Feature wise: iPhone missing the notifications system that Android have. Meaning, in iOS notifications are useless. While in Android you actually could do stuff right from notifications: answer chat messages, manage mail, and most importantly distinct between different types of notifications from the single app (for example: hide ads from app, but keep real notifications from that same app).

Support wise: pretty much any major version update for older phones makes them worse, slower and glitchy. That's been a situation for all iOS devices from the start. And Apple shamelessly keeps slowing older devices. It's better not to update the major version of iOS on iPhone at all.

Ecosystem or accessories wise: iOS just doesn't cut it. There ain't no any Bluetooth codecs for quality sound (aptX nor LDAC). And watches... oh boy. Apple Watch are simply no match for the Galaxy Watches. Apple Watch are getting clumsy health and sleep readings; notifications are useless and non-functional - it's just text on screen without any functions (in the whole iOS); and the customization of watch screen just doesn't allow making an easy to see and use watch.

Dedicated thing: there are no way to have ad blocker in your browser in iOS. They even don't allow plugins in Firefox on iOS! iOS users are forced to use internet with all the ads nightmare! This is a massive no no!

Frankly, if not for iMessage support, I'd be dropping iPhone from my life as a nightmare it is."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"We all know ""Ease of use"" was added as a category only to give iPhone 1 point. This category literally does not exist in real life."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The features I want in an iPhone are simple : first of all a delete button to delete the mistyped number in the calculator application so that I don't want to re input all the prices of grocery all over again, and  clipboard feature in which I could copy many things at once and paste as I wish."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Well said! The winner is absolutely us. Personally I’m glad that there are so many people that prefer android devices which in my eyes are just not that good. That way apple keeps developing and isn’t charging like 2k for an iPhone.

Also there’s just way too much choice in the Android world and I just want to get a good product which works flawless and can be used for years to come. So I found the apple world to be perfect for me"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Hey Marques, In the feature section you mentioned that IPhones have Focus Mode while android phones doesn’t. I would like to correct that I use an Mi Phone and it have an Focus Mode prebuilt without any third-party application activation. It might not be as advanced as IPhones but this feature is there I dont know about other android phone though I am pretty sure some brands have it."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I started with Android, then moved to iPhone, then came back to Android, then came back again to iPhone. I would say that iOS and iPhone bring me more comfort and reliability overall, but propose less technical innovations, and more slowly. I just think with time I tend to prioritize practicability over innovation, that's why I feel better with iPhone now"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Its simple if u want everything just get both a android and a apple mobile phone ✌🏻
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Strongly disagree on the Ease of Use: unfortunately you got this point wrong. No one forces you to go into customizing things on Android. It's great out of the box. And ""people choose"" iPhones simply because they don't want to learn the new system — it's not a conscious decision, it's familiarity thing and maybe ""prestige / marketing / brand power"". Apple is simply a way stronger brand, it doesn't make iOS better.

Disagree on Apps too: iPhone apps are more expensive (1), they are more restrictive (2), you can't sideload apps (3), there is fewer free apps too (4) and quality-wise it may be true that Android offers much more garbage apps, but that's the obvious consequence of an open system, I'd rather have to go through garbage than have Apple control and face all the limitations of the AppStore"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I don't get Marques' selection of categories, and unfortunately, he didn't share why he sets up this comparison the way he did. 
I would add at least two other categories (available device designs - clear winner, android [e.g., flip/foldable phones]; and security - clear winner, iPhone [e.g., Face ID]). Doesn't make the decision easier, but for sure more complete.
Plus, interoperability is irrelevant if you don't own other Apple devices, whilst flexibilty/customization is irrelevant if you use your smartphone stock (like many, if not most people do). Even now, no edge for one or the other, but then, well, why not refine this procedure and give it a come back every year or two?"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Where's money ? or affordability ? I think that is pretty big factor from customer's perspective

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,6:20 Things do become easier to use when they can be customized to suit your needs. So... I think that's only about ease of use — if your needs happen to line up with what Apple believes you need.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Price is also a driving factor - I've found you can often pay at least a third more for apple products relative to their android rivals. When you factor this in, in terms of pure value for money it is hard to beat android."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I had my pitchfork at the ready....I've put it dwn. Ecosystem is important. I run house and lfe through Android and Samsung. The hassle to change isn't worth it. But that's what they're hoping from Apple and Android...
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I think of this in a different way, see both Apple and Google are trying their best to give the end user a seamless mobile computing experience. I mean as a tech enthusiast and a power user, for both of them are equally important! I have my iPhone 14 Pro Max as my daily driver does its job seamlessly, while my S23 Ultra is my dedicated device for moving data around, using S-Pen to take down notes, very intuitive and robust Android on OneUI. So I know I am from a veryfew who love both equally and own both of them. But If I have to pick only one, it will be very difficult because as you mentioned in the video it really depends on one's personal preference really. For some the iPhone migbt appeal as an ideal device, and for some Android be the right choice so I think this debate no longer matters and both OS have matured to a level that they both are doing great in their market share."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"As a tech reviewer you get a new phone every couple of weeks, so its natural that you miss a pretty big point for a lot of people. Longevity.

iphone is famous for being able to work perfect for 3 years+ while having significantly less RAM, battery, CPU perf. 
For an android to work smoothly you gotta have 16GB RAM, latest CPU etc, that adds up to 1000$+. And still after 2-3 years its only way of use is throwing it in a trash bin because its laggy, buggy and outdated. While i can sell my 4+ yo iphone 11 for 100-200$"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Thank you for this video, and the end especially!

Too many people fail to see that there are a lot of criteria, and the weight you give to those criteria depends on your personal needs, preferences, and use cases.

The main reason I switched to iOS is the stability (and the reliability that comes with that stability), so I'm disappointed it's not on your list of criteria. Many still cite the ""it just works"" mantra as their reason for using an iPhone. The gap in stability has closed tremendously in the past decade, but if you highly value this criterion, you'll have to go to the iPhone."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Market share of mobile operating systems worldwide 2009-2023
Published by Statista Research Department, Aug 31, 2023
 Android maintained its position as the leading mobile operating system worldwide in the second quarter of 2023 with a market share of 70.8 percent. Android's closest rival, Apple's iOS, had a market share of 28.4 percent during the same period.

The best one is the most accessible to everyone. In this case it is Android since you get similar functionality and in some cases more for a lot less money. Most of iOS users are in the US and with good reason and it's because they have more buying power than the rest of the world."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I have to say, the results were not a surprise. But .... still a good job"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Until the ease of use part (included), seems like a good video. However then Updates/Support starts and dont get me wrong, I'm not mad at where the point goes to, I'm mad on how it's portrayed. First of all, the whole support thing was already an argument in ease of use, to bring that up almost seems like creating two same categories where the iphone gets two points basically for winning one. Then, yes, sure, Apples Stores give Apple the edge on control over support, however, and that should be told at least, that also comes at a price, getting an iphone repaired is very expensive and very limited to apple stores, while repairing an android can often even be done at home. The story goes on with the amount of updates the systems recieve. Yes, the average iOS gets more updates than the average Android. However you do get the choice what u go for when buying an android, Fairphone, who actually competes with Apple in amount of major updates wasn't even mentioned. Neither was the option of custom ROMs on Android, giving so many devices so many major Android updates. Yes, it's not for the average user, partly because they just dont know about it because it never gets mentioned. Like here. Again, all of that does not mean Android has to get these points. But it should get mentioned and taken into consideration when picking a winner, if only to show the win is much tighter than shown here. 
Where I disagree with the winner too is Apps. I don't know how much u know about software development and who the people u talk to are, but what u brought up here is not just missing information like before, but made extremely one sided. Starting with quantity of apps, third party app stores and the option to install apks is not even mentioned, even tough it gives u an even bigger quantity advantage and a big advantage for developers to test their apps (not just on different devices but also different kinds of users). And the advantages go on with development, to develop an iOS app you NEED a Mac. That is a huge inconvinience, specially when u develop for more than just iOS, which is probably as common today as developing individual apps. 
Havent watched further yet because therr was just too much wrong in the last two segments"

I (Android fan that I am) migrated her to an iPhone XR because it had at the time by far the best battery life for a well supported okay-ish sized phone. She STILL thinks it's impossible to use. It's not just one feature she finds horribly unusable. But by *far* the worst feature on the iPhone is the lack of ""print to PDF"". *every single time* she has to ask me to do it. And I forget every 3 months and Google it. I'm a comp sci major and even I can't figure out that damn phone / feature!"

On the other hand with my samsung i can text in whatsapp while i download my gopro videos, i can upload a story while the phone is locked in my pocket, i can connect 2 bluetooth headphones (any brand) and share my music (which i use a lot while driving my motorcycle) its crazy that the iPhone being so smooth and a great phone in many ways still can't do all this stuff."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I've been a iPhone user forever, recently switched all my devices to Samsung. For me, the only thing I miss on the apple ecosystem, is the apple watch (no equivalent good enough for the android world in my opinion). The rest? When I get home, immediately I get a notification to use my phone as a tv remote on my Samsung tv, the integration between Samsung devices is amazing. Yes, I'd sometime in the future, switch back to the apple world. But for me, I don't miss the feeling of anxiety to change my iPhone every year bc everyone around me is upgrading and I'll get behind. Every android user has their own favorite brand, wich has its own features and their own personality. I surely won't miss that."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,yup its the apple ecosystem for me. However I've always been super impressed and admired androids crazy or really cool features that their devices have. I don't plan to change anytime soon but I do need a secondary phone for work now and that Z flip 5 has full attention.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"here's my based 17 year old technology enthusiast👨‍💻, electronic device connoisseur 📱, YouTube enjoyer and part time PC nerd🖥️🤓 opinion🗿

if you want a clean looking smooth experience buy an iphone 😉👍

(100% buy top iphone for business)🕴️💼

if you want an optimized tryhard experience buy an android🤓
[if you dont understand buy iphone]

when I was 13 I got all my pocket money and some money that I earned💰 and picked a xiaomi mi 9 which was around 600$ at the time with VAT it was so cool to me but it just felt cheap compared to my uncles iphone 11 pro max that just felt so incredible😋

the mi 9 got stolen 3 years ago either on the bus or at school now I have an s20fe that I also spent my money on and it doesn't have the premium feel that I so desperately need🥲

I have an amazing new PC setup with the best peripherals imaginable and expensive is definitely the way to go✅💯

if you will buy a new phone dont cheap out,
you will not be happy with your 200$ budget phone that weighs 100 grams, gets super hot, takes 4 seconds to unlock, freezes when you press too many buttons, and is made out of polycarbonate 📱🐌🤢

you will definitely be happy with your quick, repsonsive, 120hz,  heavy duty metal phone literally gets cold if you dont touch it for a long time 🤤

I will be getting the iphone 15 pro max for my 18th birthday as its almost family tradition at this point because all of my cousins have received the top model iphone at the time on their 18th brithday🍾🍰🎉

you will have your phone with you 24/7 having a nice feeling premium phone just feels great 😋✅

if youre older than 40 buy your child or niece and nephew a new phone if they're above the age of 12 and relatively responsible, you dont need one and trust me they will be so greatful and much more happy than you, also you wont utilise it 100% so its just wasted

(its 3 am dont judge me for typing this long im procrastinating sleep and this topic is very interesting to me at this point in time and I like to write down my opinions)"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"6:47 again ease of use is terrible for a large phone and have to swipe with one hand from left to right... Please Apple let us change this. Also, add punctuation or even an email with the @ sign terrible! Not easy to use"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,4:23 I disagree two major features that iPhone does not have is 1) the ability to swipe right to left. I use my right hand to swipe out of a message. Can't do it on iPhone. I talked to many genius and... Nope ! 2) keyboard with punctuation and numbers royal pain for right hander.

My IPhone makes my life a lot easier to use and its what most all of my customers and family have. So iphone wins by the number of people that use it so popularity wins.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I’ve had both over the years, and I always go back to an iPhone. Primarily for the fact that it just works, rarely do I have an issue with apps crashing, needing to restart, or hardware issues. As you mentioned, Android has so many different phones that it’s difficult to be reliable"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"4:12 ""neither OS is really missing any gigantic features anymore""... Wait. I would argue that we can't talk to our phone and have it actually do meaningful things for us is a huge missing feature, especially in light of LLM."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,only the iphone in its original version can be auctioned for thousands… does any android do that? 😄
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I could have seen apps go either way, but here's my perspective. The largest difference for me on quality isn't necessarily ease of updating, personally app dev for IOS was more of a pain than developing for Android, though issues with continuity is real. Apple has a much more rigorous (and expensive) verification process for apps, which filters out some cheaper apps. The main reason I've heard in the industry is that app dev targets IOS because they can make more money. The counter argument is that IOS can't sideload apps. That takes the difference of 2 million and increases it pretty drastically. The early/better features on IOS for major apps is definitely a factor though for your average person. Like I said I see both sides."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Great review. Only thing that needs to be pointed out is the number of free apps, flexibility of using any app on your phone. Think android scores tons above."

We need an ecosystem where I can use my phone with different types of devices specially in work and multitasking ,

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I’m a music lover so I collect all my favorite tunes and keep ‘‘em on my phone for easy access. Always a win since I don’t need a streaming service to get that song so my data is long lasting. If only Samsung or any other android manufacturer had an iTunes like system I would switch in a heartbeat because I can organize my music to my own taste and feels. If it wasn’t for that and also the fact apps are smoother in iOS I would change back to android I’ve tried unsuccessfully.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Why is iPhone the best for a cloud gaming what is the exact reason???
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Am already used to android interface, I just wish android will have one community regardless of the android phone u use.."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Excitement is not a factor. Ecosystem should never be judged on its own. Apps on Android are as infinite as there are keyboard warriors, updates mostly do not matter, ease of use is extremely subjective and the entry difficulty should be a factor for tech people."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"To me for a daily user, the eco system is non existent. We have iPhones and iPads and an iMac in the house and never use the whole eco system thing. I see this more for businesses. Big or small. For Ease of use... Yes out of the box, download your favorite apps and just have them all on the home screen to use, Apple is probably better. (just a little) because if you do the same on an android you can just use it. But with Android customization, you can tailor your phone how you want it and then everyday use is just as easier or easier. But where I find Apple not easy to use, is when you dive into the menus. Some things are just impossible to find or it is 3-4 levels deep, where Android is laid out nice and informative."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I appreciate you and your thoughtful commentary about different technologies!! I'm an Android user who started my nature photograpy journey on a Samsung Galaxy S5. Cell phones have come a long way!

I prefer to use my Samsung Galaxy S20 plus to capture butterflies, bees, lizards, flowers, insects, and other small, easy-to-miss beauty. My work phone was an iPhone and I didn't like the output of pictures that it captured."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I would argue that apples borders around their ecosystem makes it a negative point. They cannot even make an app for their streaming service that works on my phone :D Would have loved if you said for ecosystem it is 0.5 pts for each, but with your personal weighting this or that is the winner. Breaking a tie just to have a result... The rating of this video will show how smart of a choice that was I guess. Thanks for the video."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Iphone more updates, with nothing but slowing your phone down so you buy a new one, and features android already had a year ago.  Every iphone is the same as the last one.  Zero innovation. No folds or shapes.  Iphone ecosystem is the worst in existence.  I dont care what it costs as I run flagships only and they cost more than iphone."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The complete lock in to ""do it Apple's way"" is the fact that I find so offputting with iOS. Something as simple as wanting to move some audio files to the phone? Just plug it in via USB and transfer. Apple, not so much. Apple tries to make things easy but they wind up throwing roadblocks at people who know what they want to do. Also... iPhones are deathly boring. They barely change at all. You can get an iPhone from 2019 and it's the same as today's... boring."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Dope Framework minded video. Creative, objective, slightly controversial, and as always, interesting."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Just before the launch of the new iPhone! Ok how much did they pay you for this?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The biggest thing missing from this video is iMessage. Having those extra features and seamlessness for texting is a deal breaker for a lot of people. Also the green bubble shame.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I Love the objective breakdown in the end. Because you already knew people were going to bring the pitch fork after the initial analysis....
And yes, WE (the people)  are the real winners because they bend to our needs, so we are just simply taking advantage of their little ""who's better"" game they playing... "
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Keep in mind that the samsung ecosystem has other elements to it beyond computers, cellphones and accessories. For example, I can turn my TV on using my galaxy watch with smartthings"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"So basicly iphone has won the USA, and android won the world?"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Even with the basic comparison, android is easier to use for me so android wins"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Mkbhd is maturing, finally. Android is for the creative, and the iPhone is for the business person."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I think functionality should be on the list as well. Yes the android has tons more customization but none of it works as well as apples smaller list of customization. I’ve had both for a long time as well & the glitches/hiccups or shitty optimization of all the cool shit on the android makes it pointless to me. Customization is pointless without optimization.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,definitely want a video comparing the ecosystem of Apple and Samsung
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"When it comes to the category of status, which would you say wins?"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I feel like for better or worse, once you go Iphone, or at least have had one for as long as me (since original launch) you can’t realistically switch to anything else without a major headache or feeling major investment loss. 

At this point I’ve spent hundreds if not $1000 over the last 15 years on apps and iTunes music (in probably the last holdout of actually buying iTunes music and having it on my phone / computer) I keep my phone plan cheap by having my music always downloaded, never streaming, plus I like having a library. So unless apple really screws up and makes a ton of terrible decisions, I for sure will never be switching to android and losing all of that investment (even if it is “possible”) 

Features of both phones really balance out. And I don’t have the time to really care that much about a phone and how I’m using it. It’s just a daily piece of tech. It runs the apps I need, can get in touch with people, and takes fine photos. I don’t care about the most modern features, I have standalone cameras, audio junk, everything else. So I personally love that apple still does the SE versions of the phones. That’s all I need. And I’ve been getting a good 4-5 years out of each phone, and never because they break, just because I am just wanting something a little snappier."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I like how you did this.  Very informative and helped me know that what I use is the best choice for my needs.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I don't know if other Android series or iPhones have this feature. I really like how my Pixel 6 Pro has the ability to steadily charge my phone to 100% overnight until my morning alarm. It helps not to overcharge it and keeps the battery healthy.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,You missed the Size factor. No small phones created by android anymore; iPhone 13 mini is the only option in the market! Mind boggling
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I do see the point, ecosystems are different. Sure, Apple products work great with apple but for me, the ecosystem ends not by the Phone Manufacturer. For me all the products from any manufacturer that work with a product are relevant.  Using an iPhone with a mouse, think still not there. There are thousands of devices working perfectly with Android. Except for external GPS receivers, I think they still only work with Apple. I would say that should be undecided."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Like almost all reviews, it's flawed. There is no way to compare an iPhone to an Android. iPhones are devices, Android is an Operating system. So yes, you can compare an Apple iPhone 14 to a Google Pixel 7 or a Samsung Galaxy s23 but each of them has pros and cons.

Generally, iOS (the operating software that runs iPhones) offers less features, less customization and flexibility but is more reliable and has a quicker time to patch and longer software update life cycle.

Android allows each manufacturer (and end user) to heavily customize their experience and has more features (albeit some are duplicates or somewhat pointless).

Given a price point - there's no clear winner between an iPhone and a comparable Android based device. It's a matter of preference and priorities.

If you're a Mac user, using iCloud, Apple Music, and really have no tech aptitude - iPhones' integration and one-size-fits all approach is for you.

If you are a Windows or Linux user and prefers customization - Android based phones are a better fit for you."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The review for iOS is so thorough that devs almost hate it. They really make sure that the app is good enough for the app store, which produces good quality apps as well. can't say the same about android"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"No matter what set of metrics you choose, nothing iPhone does (better) will ever make up for how blatantly Apple condescends to the consumer. Seriously, I'll never understand why millions of people continue to pay a premium for a single OEM to dictate so much of how they communicate etc. It's bizarre."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I'm a little surprised at some of the things that were straight up ignored. 

For apps, quality may be better but quantity is still a factor. Android has a gigantic lead in user base so it's not all that uncommon to find apps that just don't exist on iOS. Sure, all the major U.S. dominant apps exist but that feels so... unnecessary limiting. 

But the piece I think I'm most surprised he ignored is 3rd party acceptance in ecosystems. Have a Samsung phone but don't want to be in their ecosystem? Just buy any other Android accessory. Whereas Apple will seemingly actively punish users for buying outside their exclusivity or who try to use Apple products outside the iOS sphere. Linus Sebastian rants frequently about how the Apple Watch limits functionality if you're not using it on iOS. 

So while Apple may be more seamless, they're also suffocating in their control. Remember the old Apple slogan? ""Think Different."" Except nowadays if you want even the ability to consider to Think Different, you need to be on Android."

No, you cant, you need magsafe on your older MacBook, you need USB c for your Ipad, you need lightning for your phone, you need a special puck charger for you apple watch, some devices support wireless charging and some dont. Its a joke. Go to the google or Samsung ecosystem and you use 1 cable. They win BY FAR. anybody who cares that much about a blue bubble or whatever color it is, is a shallow individual that i dont want to be friends with anyways. Android wins the ecosystem argument hands down. and the apps. as a software developer i can tell you that you are DEAD wrong. we update our android apps FIRST. as do most. It may be the basic android phone app first, not the tablet/foldable/tv versions. but the basic phone one is updated first, and have you ever tried to use any app on the iPad that is not designed for it.... crap.

Ease of Use: 

I can literally take my Samsung Note 20 Ultra 5G anywhere in the world and get service without a problem. Whether it's repairs or data, it is the most easy to adapt to in other countries

Upgrades / Support: 

Since Apple just lost a lawsuit from throttling older phones, that should be enough to give this category to Android (especially when compared to Samsung flagships)

Apps:

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I'm an Android user, always have been, and one of my biggest peeves with Android is Software updates. If you choose not to automatically update or don't realize you've set for that, you need to do the update....update by update. You don't just get to jump to the newest update and move on. You update and then do the next, and the next and so on. Apple did it right and you shoot to the newest IOS when you ask for it and IOS does it all for you. You don't spend 2 1/2 hours getting caught up like us Android users. I also say this because I work in a store that deals for a Canadian telecom. Elderly clients will come in with issues and 80% of the time it's because it hasn't been updated in a year and a half. Just my 2 cents."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I feel that software updates on iPhone (especially version changes) are not always looking at the older device hardware.

Living in South Africa, there isnt a single official Apple store in the country. (several iStores, which are official resellers, but no Apple Stores). These 'iStores' do not have any contact numbers or emails, so getting a device checked out for issues or getting any support whatsover, requires driving 20+ minutes to get to a store, then waiting in line until its your turn, (bc its first come first serve) and this can take hours if not days (where they just say sorry they are all booked up for the day and you need to come back some other day). Then the help is generally so pathetic you cant even believe. Calling apple results in stupid wait times and phone bills because there is just a lack of care and understanding. Repair costs and the fact that device prices just go up without much new innovation or improvement makes me have a fundamental disagreement with the ethics of the company. Will be switching to Andriod at the first opportunity."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I think one not named advantage for android is that you can get an android phone new for under 100 dollars, that can basically do almost all of the stuff a 1.000$ device can do."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"If u wanna know the answer, give a 1 to 10 score to each of the categories based on how important each category is for you. Then, give a 10 to every winner in each category and another number you think is fair to the loser(coz it cant be 10 for Android for excitement and 0 for iphone.. iphone should still get like 5 or 6) then multiply and sum up, and you get the winner"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"That's how you know you shouldn't listen to him at all when ""affordability"" wasn't even a category. Ecosystem should not have been a category if you're comparing a brand to an operating system. Ecosystem would have to be brand vs. brand(apple dominates I'm not questioning it), not something like apple vs Linux. Makes no sense. When it comes to the US, apple edges out android taking up 55% of smartphones *cough* middle class *cough*.  But what about the rest of the world? Android takes up 70% of smartphones worldwide, not because they hate apple, but a lot of times it's the only thing they can AFFORD. When it comes to connecting people of world and giving them the ability to communicate at nearly any price, nothing comes close to Android."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you didn't talk about price battery designs etc
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,No one who is “tech interested” and under 50 goes with the iPhone…
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"In China many people just buy both phones because even though they prefer iPhone for all its merits, they need some functions iPhone doesn’t have, such as twin apps (two WeChat apps in one phone) and call recordings. And almost no one uses iMessage or FaceTime because of WeChat. So it’s WeChat that helps Android phones win. Plus, with $800 you can buy ten Android phones here!"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The issue is not all androids have all features 
Wherein most new iPhones have these features
It’s iPhones vs like 4 other companies on the feature front"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Personally love android freedom also variety in phone capabilities and prices
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Here is simple answer to that .
If you’re using it just as a phone , iphone/ios wins

if you use it as a tool and a phone then android wins

simple as that"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I'm getting @mrwhosetheboss vibes
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,IPhone is best for productivity and Android is best for everything elese including a major portion of productivity. So if affordability is not an issue Android is the winner.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Apple software is always worse when it comes to user experience.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I think you missed the mark on the apps category. If the reasoning on why apps are ""better"" on IOS is updates are prioritized on it, wouldn't it fall under the category named ""Updates/Support""? idk, just seems like the apps category wasn't really about the apps and more about the support. When it comes to apps, especially when you install ""Uptodown app store,"" it doesn't even come close."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"respectfully i think your way-off with the ecosystem analysis, you can tell because you switched to calling it the ""Samsung ecosystem""(not ""android eco"" which is WAY bigger, better and diverse). Yes the Apple eco connects seamlessly. But if im telling someone to invest in an ecosystem, Android provides so much choice for both budget oriented individuals and high-rollers with many brands(not just samsung) involved and integrated. You can't throw a rock without finding something that will connect to your android eco.

Cost is a major metric that should/will always be in there. For my grandma-in-law, we suggested an easy to use iPad for her but the cost was too much so android was the choice.

Otherwise a great video and the weighting system is a great idea to finalise someones decision."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Andriod will always have an edge over iphone over modded apps ,which makes out life much easier without ads,,and we can always downlaod any movie or tv show in an andriod quite easily (which is the main fucntion of a smartphone),so basically with even a cheap andriod u can enjoy all that a expensive iphone or andriod can do and youl not have to worry about your money when your display breaks and cost you a heap load of money...."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Classy? Between the 2?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I'm going to have to disagree pretty hard on the ""apps"" category. There are a few apps that are crucial for my job that are not supported by MacOS or iOS. That's an instant dealbreaker for any company in my industry. And I'd assume it's the same for many other industries. Just because all of the major social media apps are supported by both platforms, it doesn't mean that is all that matters."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Make a video on xperia 5 v 
I think sony took your advice on it"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Iphone is good for someone who doesn't regularly use deferent types of computers, who needs a good budget camera, and doesn't care about customization. iPhone can even fail to do simple things like saving a file from internet, file manager is terrible, customizing the phone (themes from other developers) is impossible. There's a gap between iOS and iPad os, no desktop feature. I have both phones, but Android is better, and it's future is getting brighter evry other day that passes."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Everytime MKBHD makes one of these, he tries so hard to make the iPhone compete. Some of the points he gave it felt so forced."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I've got to hard disagree on giving the apps win to apple. On android I can install apps from wherever I want. I can install modded apps, and run emulators. Having to stick within Apples tight set of rules for the app store is a complete deal-breaker"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,So basically apple is communist
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android is customizable but ease of use is in IPhone (does it make sense)
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I think price is a factor that most people consider
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I cannot believe my eyes, but is that a post-prod overlay at 3:03? 
Guess you’re not gods of video editing, after all. Demigods? Maybe."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Don't forget the fingerprint sensor. Especially, during COVID it was very annoying not to have it."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I tried to deep dive into the Samsung ecosystem in a span of 9 months. I really did give it a try. Surprisingly, ease of use, updates/support, apps (that rarely or really do not crash or get a bug), and the ecosystem made me realize that I preferred Apple over Samsung. It always boils down to personal preference. No need to wage war over this matter."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I wish data privacy was included as a factor.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is the most perfect tech video of u I've ever watched 🔥🔥🙌🏾🙌🏾
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Here in Mexico nobody uses FaceTime or iMessage, everyone uses WhatsApp"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Awesome
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,US not the world😂. There are more then 200 countries here😂😂😂
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Can the iphones multitask ??
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I think you didn't did justice to apps section. People from east like Pakistan, India use andriod more than ios. So in terms of getting apps to more people, developer release apps for android first and ios get usually months or sometime years later. And you shouldn't make videos thinking about just americans or west. Like you said if you jus want to get a phone and forget it you get ios, thats where americans shine, other than that i thinks android wins. in terms of where people put their money, i know price matters too but still"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Yet the Instagram app on my iPad is not optimised, but it is for the mi and Samsung tabs. Idk how the apps point went to apple 😅"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I have doubts about the ease of use of iPhones. How do you turn auto-brightness on or off? Let me help you. Go to Settings > Accessibility > Auto-Brightness. I can’t imagine why Apple can’t put that simple setting under Display & Brightness.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Excitement should go to Apple 100%. Nobody excited for some folding phone or whatever. Interested to hear about them - yes, maybe, but excited - “doubt”. On every Apple event at least 1/3 are android users. Just to hear about what’s new. They may be not interested in buying one, but it always a wait for these shows. I am not even talking about how excited people who use Apple products. So yeah, for me, this category is completely wide of mark. I agree with other tho."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Ive been using android since samsung s2
Now rocking s22 ultra..

D missus uses an iphone

And unfortunately her photo collection dates back to 2010 i think

And often not, her storage becomes full, and the phone becomes sluggish,

It has to do with how NVME reads memory, the electron ( or something) moves much slower when NVME is full, hence why iphones should never be used exceeding 70% of storage..

Furthermore, we don't have a mac, only windows pcs at home and work.

If she deletes the photos from the phone, it deletes from the icloud,
Her phone was basically useless for 3 days while the ios was busy pushing backup photos to the cloud, freeing up 10 then 30 gb, but the "" thumbnails"" will forever be in the photos app.

Also, icloud only allows 1000 items to be manually downloaded to pc in zip folders..  

To transfer a collection of photos and videos from iphone to pcs, without the files gets jumbled up and named like encrypted files, you have to PAY for an app. I had an iphone se once for youtubing, but sold it off when i encountered this problem.

And the missus's problem becomes my problem.

Together with "" live photos "" that just eats up space

Some default settings out of the box on iphones is ridiculous
- eats up battery life with lift to wake
- easts up storage space with live photos

Android phones will never have storage issues because

1) you can safely transfer all your photos to the cloud - google photos

- 1 click overnight

Then google photos AI will delete 
1) duplicates from your phones
2) duplicates from whatsapp
3) duplicates received elsewhere

You can free up your storage

You can 1 click transfer everything to the pc overnight ( iphone and itunes will have "" connection "" issues )

You can access whatsapp media files via gallery and even windows to clean up your phone

Also other benefits of android

Type C
drag and drop file system
Fast charging
Fast transfer
Whatsapp

The ability to download from the browser, access it, sideload it etc, like an actual pc, a real smartphone.

Android is available in tvs, android tv boxes. And integration with smart devices and home appliances. 

Android phones can easily share high resolution photos via whatsapp

So yeah, for me Android is the best."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The world is not around America my friend .you only talking on behalf of the American people rest of them in android world .
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,IPhone is pure marketing jaggernaut. Feature wise and value for your money you get more in Android Flagship phones. Apple just knows how trap their users in their system. They stop innovating while a Samsung ajdvHuawei are always trying to bring out something newn to the market.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Why bro why...?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Marques should have read the comments of this video before uploading, thats where the real answer is."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,How is the ecosystem usage cross platform is not easy and you are forced to buy the same platform gadgets.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,whoa at 3:03 your hand goes behind the computer screen in the background
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"for me what I like about iPhone is it's camera and it can play any games there's no lag or whatsoever, and on Android after hearing about Fairphone 5 that It will get 10 years of software update, I will stick more on to android, and because iPhone is more expensive"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,My takeaway is ALL of Android vs Apple.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Maybe it should be called. iOS vs Android.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I had been using android up to 2020, and using iPhone for the last 3 years, 
There are only two features that I really miss.
1. The keyboard, I type Armenian a lot. The Armenian keyboard is horrible on iPhone, some weird arrangement without possibility to choose one you are used to (yes in Armenian there are multiple arrangements of keyboard 🙃). If this is something you get used to during time there is something which is really a problem, It does not have autocorrect and gestures, and actually even autocorrect for English is not getting close to the quality of GBoard, and unfortunately GBoard for iOS simply does not support a bunch of languages that it does on Android, including Armenian.
2. The call history and the app itself, particularly the feature I miss the most is when you type a small part of the phone number you remember, on androids it makes suggestions from history, this is sooooo convenient, especially if you are doing a lot of calls to new phone numbers. And simply the history is supeeeer short."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"great video but the Ease of use is the only win for IOS, the positves here for IOS are actually negatives for me.  6-1 is the actual score for Android.  Samsung tablets and phones and pixel phones are the clear Android winners."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"When I was using android phones that weren’t Samsung, I used to download their internet and music apps because the default ones were pretty bad"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Definitive? Wait until he does the same again next year, and the following and…"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I can't live without accessibility like live caption. you should include accessibility category
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Lemme guess Marques, the next video would probably start like, “I’ve been using this iPhone 15 pro for almost two weeks now”"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I have to have both. So I do! Nowadays android is way better for business for me. I can sign pdfs so quickly. Apple, can lock my kids phones and talk to them much easier."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,think you missed a very important category in reparability.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Apple casually taking on a 1000 android brands single handed
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about performance? and cosistency?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I have a startup company that is basically an APP, and iOS is the last priority. We will always be sure to have Android working properly"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Here are we comparing iOS vs android or Apple vs other phone's company that uses Android plus their respective softwares!! Coz it seems different to me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i still use the blackberry bold 9900
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,What about the price vs features you get ?!.....ANDROID win by 1000%

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android is the best! You can finaly customize it to look like an iphone 😂
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"IPhone is just for texting, that's all."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The split screen in S22 using one hand operation + is easily the best thing that a smart phone can have.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,In short The BEST is in the EYE OF THE BEHOLDER😁
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Apps goes to apple? I sold my device because there's not much variety of apps plus its strictness 😂 Android able to use outside play store apps tho. Many company uses Google workspace and android is really compatible with it too
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Great Video! I honestly love competition because it always leaves the customer somewhere to run when they are let down.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The end made me laugh. I actually prefer android, because iphones irritate me with how little you can change it to your liking. I am rocking a Galaxy S23 Ultra and an IPhone 14. I've got both worlds in my pocket, and 80% of the time I pull out my galaxy. Better battery life, WAY better cameras, has a built in S Pen, and charges ridiculously fast in a pinch. But you do you."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"18 minutes later, we’re back to square 1. Great!"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I honestly think you should do a separate video on Galaxy/TouchWiz<One UI vs iPhone/iOS because a lot of the consistency in iOS has been in Samsung's software from the beginning of the 'Galaxy S' & I think to some people Samsung's software is more familiar than even generic Android because most consumers that have had an 'Android' have basically had a Galaxy. Plus, Samsung has more of the features that Google doesn't offer, more developed ecosystem & more market share in general & especially in the US than even Google. 💯 Just my 2 cents."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I know people who had iphones and switched back to Androids because everytime they turned around on their iphone either something was limited or they couldn't get into their phones via memory types of situations or they bumped the phone against something hard on accident and cracked it or broke it completely like an egg and when they went to tell the apple store associate it was an insurance issue or they got stuck having to buy a new iphone like it's one of these plastic cars on the roads we drive today. One brush with something hard and off to the junkyard it goes then to get replaced by another more expensive iphone if they discontinued the one they had or they'll sell them a refurbished one. I always kept an android and love the fact that I have no insurance issues if I have a problem with my device or any restrictions via apps or customizations to my device. I currently have an LG Stylo 6 I've had it for a while I
m due for an upgrade since the network for LG phones aren't as strong as most other phones in use and on the market now, I'm looking at a Moto Stylist, I did want the big boy samsung but the moto has some things the samsung doesn't plus they take GREAT pics my son has one and it's responsively quick he loves it."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The most important factor for me is security.  I was an Android user and you will find tons of news about a lots of Android apps with malware or virus.  Apple store bubble is more effective way to protect the users.  Not everyone is a tech wizard to read every app permissions.   The other factor is customer service, is fast and reliable. I had to wait over 5 months for a google pixel replacement."

Data Security & Data Recovery, we will all replace or loose our phones at some point & more & more each day our lives are stored in the phone, so as well as all the features, it would good to know which is more secure? (Is Google really reading all your mail) & which is easier to find? or lock down when lost?  & ultimately which is easier to replace with all your settings as it was? .. for me personally these are more important or the most helpful to have as well as all the other stuff.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Really enjoyed this! One modification I did to your rubric is that I give partial points to each platform (fraction that totals to 1) for each of the attributes, since as you said, the winner might be only be a small amount, or it could even be tied. I think this accounts for the fact that there are some areas where one platform wins by a LOT, while in other areas, the difference is much less. The all-or-nothing scoring might make the difference between the platforms seem greater than it is (fwiw, after i did this partial scoring and my personal weighting, my results came up with 10.7 for android and 11.3 for iOS -- so close as to be negligible -- and this actually maps to my personal experience, which is that i am really happy to use both)."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The way you evaluated the ecosystem by drawing a comparison between Apple and Android, without mentioning the term ""sideload/Custom APKs"" speaks volumes about how tech content creators on YouTube can often guide viewers down a narrow path."

After having several Google Pixels, and all of them having massive issues that Google wouldn’t fix I went to the iPhone.

I can’t customize it as much but holy shit I’m blown away with how well it works without much thought.

And if something does go wrong Apple tends to sort it out really quickly. A friend had a speaker issue and it was fixed in under 45 minutes. That was kinda insane to me."

But, as time goes on, I find myself using less and less of the features and options that Android gives and just using my phone as a basic phone for text/call/email. Because of this, I've been contemplating switching to iPhone and the fact that my wife and most of my friends are on iPhone currently. Although I haven't made my decision yet, this video was very helpful and brought up some topics of each that I hadn't thought about. I'm going to continue to think about what phone I'll get next and hopefully I'll make the right decision for me. Anyway, thank you for this video as I found it very helpful. Take care!"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I disagree with ease of use on ios. There's no back button, gestures are inconsistent depending on what app you are using and it tends to try to automate certain features which can add inconsistency to someone that can't understand what is happening. Android may function differently based on what phone you have but once you learn it for that phone it's very consistent."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Outstanding!!  If Fanboys and girls on either side get upset by this, they weren't listening.  You clearly show strengths and weakness for both and left it to the consumer to decide what's most important to them.  I would add ""status symbol"".  Not important to me, (I have an Android phone at present) but I'm not a brand evangelist.  But the iPhone is the clear winner when it comes to a Status Symbol.  Which is strange now that a lot of Samsung Android phones cost more than the top of the line iPhones.  And the build quality is every bit as good.  I can afford any phone I ""want"". I have a Samsung S22 Ultra because it is the best option for my needs available at any price."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Since new iPhones are on the way, all of the Apple staff members are promoting the company on YouTube like this video, there are others youtubers too whom you will soon see on youtube showing how great Apple is. The fact is that Apple is a lazy company and will not innovate this year either, nor will they do so with the iPhone 16. However, this egoistic lazy firm, costing far more than what it provides to customers, may try to innovate this year. The amusing thing is when people will understand the value of their money. ... when they understand that Apple solely produces phones for the US market and always puts the US ahead of all other nations, despite charging significantly more for their phones outside the US. The margin by which Samsun defeats the iPhone 15 will be intriguing to observe, as will whether Apple offers any worthwhile upgrades this year."

I'm a software developer as well and would never dream of prioritizing IOS development over Android. Apple is so stingy and infamously difficult to deal with when it comes to certifications and getting updates and new apps approved for their store. Hell it's even widely known that Apple can just rip your app off their store whenever they want, just because they feel like it. It sounds like you only talk to the big tech devs like Meta and Google that have the notoriety and man power to push through Apple's ridiculous terms and conditions."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I agree with pretty much everything you have said. I would have brought up a few other features on the iphone and a few ease-of-use things that android has as well, that IMO would basically mean a tie in ease of use and in features categories, resulting in the same overall score anyway.

But I just wanted to leave a comment about something coming to android. An app called Bepper is getting closer to release and it allows full iMessage on android, and it works very well!. Personally, I wish everyone in both camps would switch to signal simply because it is universal, has all the same features and allows video calls just like facetime. But as far as the ""blue bubble green bubble"" thing, you will be able to have imessage functionality and be a blue bubble with android :) Though you still have some caveats regarding facetime"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,If andriod didnt exist apple would add zero new features to the iphone and charge you double the price
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Great video ! Just want to put that out there before my comment. I disagree on ease of use though. Tried getting my mom some extra storage on iCloud and it took me about 30 minutes for the whole setup, passwords, and everything else apple threw my way. Android was one fingerprint scan and a plan choosing - literally a 20 second thing.  Now I understand what you mean with ease of use and icon placement or overhauling an entire app, but when I think about ease of use it's more to do with complex stuff you have to do on your phone, rather than people not figuring out how to close a phone call because the icon has been moved a bit lower."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Would be fair to mention that iOS is a locked OS which makes apps and updates little bit hard to compare among these two. Software development is quite different for both platforms, there is no need to focus on different screen sizes on iOS.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I've decided to split. I'm keeping my Sony Xperia with a basic texting sim card for two factor authorization. The fingerprint scanner is safer security than Face ID and I have flexible space with a micro SD card and file manager. It's a great screen for watching video, connects natively to my Sony camera both with wifi sharing and as an external monitor. The Sony Xperia phones are awesome for content creators and professionals in multimedia. I also want the fingerprint scanner to help keep my crypto gapped from my new iPhone I'm getting and the iPhone will be for apple pay and cashapp. The reason I'm getting iPhone is the ecosystem. Not by my choice but my job has me on Mac and I have an iPad that's hindered by not having an iPhone, also I just constantly feel segregated via text for having green texts and iMessage will work across everything I use daily. So I'm hoping it will make everyone else feel better when communicating with me. But I'm still in the features and flexibility camp so I'm keeping my Sony for all the things it does that iPhone doesn't especially the headphone jack because the built in DAC drives my IEMs to musical perfection and I'm not one for Apple's mid quality music streaming. It feels like the best digital footprint separation I can do while still participating in the times. The iPhone might ring off the hook all day with notifications, but my Sony will only be used to talk to family and my partner so I can take a break from work. 

I also anticipate PHONES being replaced in the next couple years by fully featured wearables and ideally I'd like smart glasses for daily driving and a powerhouse phone for a networked mini computer. 

Not to mention I don't want Google or Apple knowing everything about me so they'll have to piece things together between the two if they want all my data points."

I know people who have been using Galaxy smartphones and introducing them to an iPhone is extremely confusing for them because using an Android Galaxy is so much easier for them to use. Introducing an iPhone or Android to a kid for their first smartphone, I guarantee whichever one they stick with first will be ""easier"" to use, no matter what special ease of use features the phones provide."

I would say that 90% of people consider cost as a huge factor!

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"In ""easy to use"" I would add that someone that comes from an android phone finds it hard that there is no ""back"" or ""return"" button, you have to use each native apps button to go back it is annoying. Also as a software engineer is easier to develop for Android than Apple, the ways to solve problems on Kotlin are way easier than Swift (I am talking about component or implementing the UI that was develop, there are more restrictions on Apple), you can ask any software engineer about this to confirm, also the APKs and external ways to add applications on Android is a plus. I think why some of this applications have more support from Apple is because of they are already Apple users (like everyone in the USA), or there is money in the back because as a software engineer I would pick to develop on Kotlin everyday instead of Swift."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Regarding Apps, I have a different opinion. Why?
Simply because Apple limits very much what Developers are allowed to do. Look at Firefox browser being forced to use Apples rendering engine, SwiftKey not being allowed to add a 5th row with numbers to their keyboard or how Apple forces developers to process all in-app purchases through apple only.
Sorry, but for me, the app-category goes to Android."

I think for apps it should have been a tie. Because with androids most apps don't require weekly/monthly subscriptions. A good example is global EQ apps and ringtones. When I switched to iPhone I was shocked how hard it was to have a custom ringtone and how all the EQ apps wanted to charge a subscription.

But ecosystem I agree. Apple's experience across devices AND airplay is incredible. Android can have janky experiences even with Samsung's ecosystem."

Jimmy: But Dad, Android said I could drive it!

Android: Yeah, I did. And I'm not backing down. Jimmy is old enough to learn how to drive, and I'm going to teach him.

Apple: But he's just a kid! He could get hurt!

Android: He's not going to get hurt. I'll be right there with him.

Apple: Fine, but if anything happens to him, you're going to regret it.

Android: I won't regret a thing. This is about Jimmy learning to be independent and responsible. And I'm going to make sure he does.

Apple is too basic and nonexciting for me or anyone who truly loves new technology and the latest tech. I've had the Z Fold since the Z-fold 3, got the 4 when it first came out and just got the Fold 5.

There are some statement which we cannot agree.

1. There no apple store everywhere, May be in US and some country you find, but not all countries where the apple phones have been selling. 
2. Regarding the Update promises, yeah we do agree with Android like some not up to the promises, When it comes to iPhone, All the older phones are not receiving all the features, There would be only 60% features only pushed to the older iphones as OS upgrades. where as in Android you cannot see that, If the company promises for an OS upgrade they have to work on all the features of Android numbers and yes they push 90-95% of OS upgrades to the phones till the count the brand promises like Samsung, Pixel and etc.,

That might be the reason the Android phone companies are not promising for long term updates, But here comes the Samsung and Pixel devices with 3-4 years of OS upgrades and 4-8 years of security updates(8 years update with fairphone) . :) :)."

Or perhaps for developers you can atleast download a text-editor and or virtualisation since it's the new computer right? NO BUY A MACBOOK FOR THAT!!!

I think you're measuring continuity between devices, not ease of use.

While we're at it, personally, I find walled-gardens such a turn-off. Instead of being able to mix and match to get the best set of devices for you, you have to either go all in (which doesn't work for everyone, eg Mac OS doesn't run some of the programs I use daily) or not at all."

2. Cellular ipad means data only, not for calling. for android 5G/LTE tabs, it's just like a phone with a huge screen. 
3. USB-C is the best thing ever. been on android for ages."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Forgot to mention that with Android you have better prices. You want something cheap, mid or expensive? Android. Apple is expensive to more expensive."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,What about data security aspect? Could you please explain the pros and contras in both softwares (maybe in another vid)?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,EASE OF USE? 1:1. LOL.....2 STEPS ON ANDROID AND 5 STEPS ON IOS. I GOT BOTH. I KNOW THAT.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,What if the real winners are the friends we made along the way
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android is the winner here ❤️
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Apps point goes to Android. There are many apps which are not even available for ios where in case of android there are so many apps. Also the beta test always comes first on ios.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iPhone every single time
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,A huge factor not covered is lack of variety on pricing. Apple will in every category demand high pricing. Infact to use the apple eco system you will fork out much higher price. And there aren't any other options too. It's a monopoly basically.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Unfortunately, there is no substitute for experience with a device and it’s software system. And, it takes time and effort to get tech where you want it. Despite having tried a flip android based phone, I am staying with Apple devices, blended with Google workspace offerings. I even mix in a little Outbox, as Microsoft has designed some beautiful apps for IOS."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I love your videos. Watch just about all of them. However I think you should add longevity and resale value also to that list. I've had multiple Samsung flag ships  including the Fold and I've had two pixels and at the end of the day about one year in both android device significantly slowed down, they weren't loading content properly, apps start crashing and my battery was dead by 1pm esp on the pixel phones. Then you have the looming issue of paying 1,000+ for a android for it to lose 65 to 75% of it's vaule in the first year in insane. Phones aren't cheap disposable devices anymore like they were in 2005 so reasle and longevity need to be on this list."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,What about security?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"A thing that comes up a lot from people who swear by the iPhone is how important iMessage is, and that texting someone with an android is annoying because you only get the default sms. But android devices has the RCS(Rich Communication Services) system, which is basically the same thing as iMessage. Apple just won't let you communicate as easily with android phones, because they don't want their devices to work well with stuff that isn't apple."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Spoiler: nothing is better
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"For me is it and will be always iPhone.
I've switched a couple of times, but I always go back to iOS.
The simplicity, the eco system, updates, APPLE PAY!!!, Security it is just better (for me).
With Android I'm always looking for the right setup, the right feel and it is always sluggish.
There is only 1 Android phone that I can name that made me happy and that was the Samsung S8.
After that it never happened again."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"after 17 years, still i can't see history in ios calculator 😀"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Ease of use 😂😂😂
Crazy!"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Wow, I knew Google was the winner"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I would have to slightly disagree with this part 7:34 ""no bloatware in iPhone"" aren't all system apps bloatware? I know a lot of people who use chrome and Gmail on the iPhone, so for them safari seems bloatware (just nick picking a little)"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Poor man rich man , it's  not always about practicality, it's about style and personality haha.........
What about Poco $500 with high end processor and features......money saving winner for sure.😊😊....."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I'm surprised Focus Mode is only available on IOS now, I've had that feature for four years now on my budget android phones. I can choose what apps to ""silence"" and then set a timer or toggle the Focus Mode on/off from the notifications shade as needed. Very useful for studying or lectures."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,No one care about the Apple ecosystem other than Americans 😂
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Here in India, people do not know one thing about ecosystem, customization and many do not even know everything about iphone and android features, but they just buy iphone because it has an apple logo on it. Apple has made this kind of brand value.
Yes, the iphones are good and has amazing camera but I always prefer Samsung because it has the best and cleanest UI, amazing camera(can't beat iphone in videography yet but in photography Samsung is the absolute beast) and Samsung has the most amazing customization features."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,cant we all just be friends
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,👌Thanks!!!

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,where is Rapairability??? isnt that an improtant factor when selecting a phone anymore?!
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,If I even leave Apple am getting the Sony phone.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,most people choose iPhone beccause of the ecosystem.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"iphone still doesn't support split-screen mode and just implemented widgets recently while android has been using it since its early years, also there are lots of android phone that can full charge in just 30 mins and it makes me laugh at iphone users calling themselves superior"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Without even watching this ANDROID wins. Next competiton please...
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Fairphone has 8 years of updates
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Outside the US (especially in Africa), ecosystems font matter. But when we struggle to meet up, android makes it easier."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"A phone is an extension of ourselves, and the idea that one platform is objectively better for everyone is simply an impossible dream. I personally love Android, and I have my reasons, but my friend loves his iPhone, and he has his reasons.

He doesn't have to argue why, and neither do I. It's simply a matter of personal taste, preferences, priorities, and tech style among others. The same thing goes with Xbox and Playstation: there are no objectively better platforms. Only the one that better suits you and your needs :)"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Interestingly enough, I only care my android has the first two that Android one."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Hey Marques, you forgot about automatization options in iOS...Can you do that in Android? Can Samsung or Google can notify you that your phone has been charged up to 85%? Just asking I really do not know"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,What’s the different between focus mode on APPLE DEVICES and Do not Disturb ON ANDROID DEVICES ???😊
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"It seemed kind of odd to me to just view at Samsung when talking about the Android ecosystem, while there is the growing Pixel ecosystem and Microsoft generally supporting Android over iOS with stuff like Phone Link. 

Nevertheless, the win obviously has to go to Apple. So I agree with your conclusion but not your arguments."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,😂 Too first world review it seems... who am I to complain though...
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,REALLY had to stretch to make Apple win those categories it won. It's 7-0 in favor of the Android. Objectively so.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Apple is like gaming console and android is like PC
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Great video.  Thanks. 
Could you do a comparison between the Google and Apple wallet. Would love to see that.  Thanks"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I don't see what all the hub bub is about, the best phone ever made, was made in 2018 and it was an android phone. The Moto Z3 (not the Z4 and its punch holed screen and unresponsive underscreen fingerprint reader)"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,How can camera not be a category?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The real winner is the friends we made along the way
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Support and update how about using custom rom to get latest security updates on android?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it's hard to say and choose 1 side these days but it's hard to migrate from 1 os to another because than you have to buy all new devices to keep personal ecosystem working
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I completely disagree about apps. I couldn't care less if I get the latest version of Instagram 2 weeks later than an Apple user. Android allows apps to have a lower level of control over the system, allowing a wider variety of apps to exist so you can do more with your phone.
For example, last month I was in a hotel room wanting to watch Netflix on the (non-smart) TV in the room and all I had was my phone and a USB-A charging cable. No problem--I just grabbed an app that allowed streaming media over USB to the USB port in the TV. Good luck doing that on an iPhone."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Arguing which phone is the real winner is like arguing with other people about how much you love your wife and telling the other guy his wife a terrible... Each person have their own  personality
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,broke boys rock androids

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"This video is well-made to the end. You are the one who made me a fan of One Plus in 2016 and you are one who will make me a fan of Pixel very soon. As an Apple user since 2012, I believe the iPhone and Android both are great in their own way now. Thank you for this video, Marques <3"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it's 2023 and we are still discussing this cliché.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I would say I was surprised that the apps went for IOS as my main reason on android is APK. And that it is possible to release apps that don't need the approval process. Emulation and ad removal would not be possible in the same way on iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,One of the biggest features Android had kept me with is the clipboard. Copy multiple items and they're still there
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"iOS has a lifestyle advantage. If you have an iPhone, you show ""style"" and ""wealth"". 
I think it's also shows your lack of imagination as you have what everyone else has, but hey, you do you.
Also, get a 3rd party messaging app, my god. green vs. blue bubbles is the downfall of society if that's your biggest problem. Idiocracy calling."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I’ve used a lot of androids and iPhones. In my personal experience iPhones are a lot more reliable. I also believe they tend to have great battery life because of how they are optimized. They can be kind of boring at times but the slogan goes “it just works.” Currently on the iPhone 13 Pro. This thing is still a champ. Works just like the day I got it.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Based on these headlines you picked, you weren't baise at all. Explanation well done"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"having gone from iPhone to Pixel, i can say that Google has blown Apple away in the ""ease of use"" category; especially if you are a Gmail user, or on a Google domain (suite)."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I kinda disagree with the apps of a thing going to iphone, infact to the reverse is the case as many people are staying on android because of the limitless number of apps.
As you said there are rare gems in the playstore, think of it this way, if the rare gems are 1 in 1000 apps, you can calculate the number of gems available to android since it has 2 billion more apps than Apple store."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I can't see 3 taps to turn some settings on/off being easier to use than 2 on android. Overall, ease of use is definitely Android. Everything else is comparable but audio lag still much better on iPhones but so many other things are better on Android so it should be the winner overall"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iPhone is much better in my experience. Android performance degrades quickly.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Hey guys, I want to know what's the fold phone in 12:17? Is it from oppo?"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"As someone that has used both android and iphones I'll take Ease of Use and Ecosystem everytime!! Give me a phone that has smooth transitions and just works reliably everytime. Boom. I'll never forgive google/HTC for their shitty updates that made using their phone a nightmare and slowed it down to the point it was an expensive paperweight. Plus samsung galaxy and how slow those processors were trying to open apps, no ty. I think androids are fine fyi but i just don't need to spend countless hrs wasted to customize every part of my phone. Plus Apple support is an important factor. Good vid Mr. Brownlee."

And each time I feel like uploading any picture or  video to any other app such as insta, tiktok, or any random app, iphone will act as a super wall and the requesting app will be given permission to only that specific image/video... this by far is the most underrated feature on an iOS ecosystem! 
When I do this in Instagram, I can see Instagram crying missing a puzzle in understanding me by reading all my images/videos from my gallery.. which it wants to have access unnecessarily by default setting... the same is with most apps.. they just want access to all my pictures/videos.. but but iphone tot he rescue.. it keeps build privacy wall with granular controls... super Love this feature!"

Even if the upgrades are shit, let’s be real, people are still more excited for the launch of iPhones over Androids. Hence, why iPhone sales are better than everyone else. You should also add status. Apple screams one level better than Android products. Also, resell value, android resell is ass. Why buy Androids brand new lol"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"As a user of both platforms, you totally missed out dual sim, travel support and price. Also, you forgot to tell that iOS updates slow phones every major update. Furthermore, the USA is not the entire world. Prices are a shame in some countries.

How brilliantly people ignore so many simple things you can't do in an iPhone. !
Can you share a link ?
Just download work mode in iPhone then boom half of these features are not available to you anymore."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Guy is left with no topic to discuss 😂
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Good Video 😎 A couple of issues that probably only concern those in the UK and maybe Europe is the ruling recently on having the ability to change your battery yourself because a new ruling he been approved for this option to return. I know can find who where what when about this.Need to know more 
Second is the ability on the transfer of 4k and 8k files is problematic in ability to quickly move these files and the varying ability to do this.Thats why the SD Card was so important .You swap a full SD card faster than transferring these files with wich ever option is the best to do this and it's still  limited an as fast as they are still can't compete with the seconds it takes to remove this card that many still have as a choice. 
The Third  issue is the space which is being addressed by only offering the new 256gb option no 128gb standard is pointless with all the updates with the APPS using the space up.Most of us regular people use their phones to fly to the Moon if they could .
The Forth issue is speed is awesome on one level but the internet as a whole has issues  of to many bottlenecks of Videos not playing in an article to commercials that are just plain about the awesome game only to find it's a bait and switch. The game is obvious different from the advertised one.
That's an everbody issue???
The Fifth is the ability to quickly stream is also an issue. The companies want you to stream but it get more expensive to do so.Especialy to those that have a monthly plan that can't afford an unlimited amount plan of content. They use it up because they are unable to correctly verify how much is data will be used up. It is not truly clear.Just basis issues and you can find out more than I can Hint,Hint🤣🤣🤣
Again Good Video 😎"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Fantastic Video and very very spot on..I clearly find for my needs being my phone is used for business (file management) and also have a lot that runs off my phone and controlled by my phone that Android has always been my clear winner...I feel like Apple is very geared towards Teens as most kinds can't live without Apple...I find Android works more flawless in my life and think if more Apple people where open minded and tried Android they would jump out of the Apple Cult...I know a few who have and wish they did so sooner....Love the Fold 5 and came over from S22 Ultra....
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,This is what we need to!!!

Good video though."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I love apple cause of their simplicity and user friendliness. Don’t have to do a million things to your phone. It’s a phone and it does what it should especially if it’s an iPhone. I just bought the 14 PRO MAX from S21 was iPhone for years but iPhone broke got a good deal on S21 I loved that phone but then I realized all the extra crap I didn’t need. So glad to be back with IPhone. And gonna stay with from here on out.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I don’t understand why people feel the need to debate preferences, it makes zero sense. All we’re doing is dividing ourselves from each other.. use what works best for you, not what works best for others."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,In the app section you didnt take into account what some apps let you do on Android that would be impossible on Iphone. From Emulators to customization to sideloading apps... This point is close just because devs are usually cleaner on Iphone. But I would give it to Android just for the infinite app possibilities.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I knew that this would be Apple bias😅, I don't agree with you on the Updates and Support, Android just ticks all the boxes..."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Apps category is BS... 🤣
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Great take. I’m a boring no-nonsense old guy who couldn’t care less about customization and excitement. My job is complicated enough that I’m not interested in complicated gadgets. Ease of use, updates/support, and ecosystem take the top spots, so I carry an iPhone."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,You should do an update video on the pixel 7 pro. Debating if i should get the 8 pro or switch to the iphone 15 pro max
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Great system Marques! This is the most fair comparison I've seen :)
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The biggest plus point for me in IOS is long software support and no bloatware. However Android is clear winner as far as customisation and new features. Tell me who does not want his phone charged 70 percent in 30 odd minutes when you are in hurry?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,There are lakh of iphone cases available in market as compared to Android so customization is more in iphone.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Incredibly well summarized, especially the ending ! 👌"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,There are dependent stuffs too right? Like customization and ease of use. I would say a customized setup gives better satisfaction improving ease of use.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I would always use android as my primary device and an iPhone for business.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,How is cost not one of the categories? It doesn’t matter how good the features are if you can’t afford it. 0:24
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The real winner is the consumer. Competition is good and pushes companies to come out with the best phone each year.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I dont care i use both. Adroid for gaming iphone for work purposes
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I believe that side loading and customization are only important for maybe 5-10% of customers. I think some engage and after a while, the thrill is gone. Ease of use and simplicity ends up being the greatest day to day factor over time for the vast majority of customers and that’s who Apple targets.

I can also see how Apple’s ecosystem and the need to protect things (iTunes music purchases, ApplePay setups and FaceID) causes conflicts. Creating easy open file systems exposes the iPhone to more attack vectors, risking the phone’s security. So a weighted decision is made to compromise accessibility in the name of security and ease of use. This is not a bad compromise for 80-90% of phone buyers, as many are not techies. I’m a techie and I use both OSes. And while I can appreciate the flexibility that Android provides, the truth is that on a day to day basis, those advantages have little impact on how I most often use my phone. For that reason, I prefer to use my iPhone."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The greatest Android feature is the universal back button
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"For me at least, I will never buy an Iphone or Ipad because they are too dang expensive. I can get an android tablet or phone that's just as good for a fraction of the price."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I won't bother watching cause I know the answer is ""both are good in some ways"". So nothing new to expect."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"You can't compare them. Apple sells the equivalent of domestic appliances, since they just work and you can't do anything else to them, and Android sells computers that you can customize almost every bit of it. Even the type of users are different."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I think you missed Google's ecosystem in general and how easy it is to use

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Hmm, so I ran through formula for myself. I have used the latest from Samsung, Iphone ( save the Pro Models ) and Pixel. The answer for me is already hinted at.
In a close call , I had Android over Apple, some things that seem clear apple wins , werent so much to me for idiosyncratic reasons; like Apps, Ease of Use and Ecosystem were much closer.  Where Apple gets a leg up is in popularity ( who has one? damn near everyone)...which leads into the walled garden and ecosystem. Currently using  IP14, but Ill end up
on the P7 due to Esim issues."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I felt like you knew android is better in anyway but was just biased on your conclusion bcz of your affiliation with US..

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The one major thing you failed to mention during your battery spiel was the inability to get true battery health stats from Android devices. The system just doesn't have this at the API level, and is extremely difficult to get accurate readings from, usually involving thirdparty apps monitoring your CPU usage and the like to even get a tiny grasp of your device's battery health... This is a major point for iOS."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"TBH, I think that one aspect that keeps pushing me away from iPhones is the fact that I don't want to have the same freaking phone every iPhone user has.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Ease of use is definitely not apple it hase terrible file management system than android you can't even download a file from browser that easily on apple ios and for security & privacy you can turn off & on permission for each and every app separately
For file sharing with other platforms like linux, windows, even with mac definitely android is a king
If my mom want to download certain images or videos with ios she got sick 😫  but with android its very easy so definitely don't agree with marcus brown lee in ease of use"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android does have a focus mode. its just not called focus
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Switching between next generation of same phones should have a category or a sub category. Im an android user for years but i would say iphone is a definitive winner

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iOS is not really optimized. it's more of a LIMITED OS. The keyword here is LIMITED not OPTIMIZED.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android is the best. 😅
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Totally agree with this. 
I used to be an Android person. I loved Android’s sky’s the limit kind of customizability. 
As I get older and busier, I starting to like simplicity, smooth operation; I want a reliable phone and apps — that I can count on anytime, that’s not buggy and wont crash on me. 
I became an Apple user."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Never had one pop-up, ever, on an iPhone (10+ years)
The other day, my friend was navigating with his android phone, and just in driving a little bit, SEVERAL pop-ups came up... and you know what? We couldn't even figure out which app was CAUSING this!! Nuts. No thank you. Not for me."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Apps and how they flow on the phone, and for me I’ll have to give that to Apple. Basic apps such as Instagram or Whatsapp feel like really premium to the use (not talking about money 😂) and as I read/saw somewhere else and now confirm with Marques, developers develop apple apps to run at full quality on Apple devices, they probably dedicate more time to making them almost perfect since they’ll be used pretty much on all line ups with no changes or adjustments, contrary to Android, where standard wouldn’t fit for all the phones."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Idk if I live in a third world country but i have been thinking a lot in the reselling price for changing my phone. Cause here ssg looses their value so faster that the investment hardly will be closer in a trade off

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I'm gonna have to disagree with ease of use. Your definition of ease of use didn't take into account new users. I can guarantee that if you put a person who hasn't used either system, they will tell you Android is easier to use. So saying iPhone is easier to use FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ALWAYS BEEN USING IT does not mean they are easier to use...

As well, while i understand and agree with your definition of ecosystem and why iPhones are better, for me that category is actually a minus for the same reason mentioned earlier in regards to walling you in etc...."

How easily you can access the notifications panel, quick settings, swtting button on top, easy copy paste and most importantly how easily you can navigate the cursor in a word- for android its one tap and it will put the cursor there."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Wow the rubric is awesome.  This is the best way to rate and yes which one is the best really up to an individual.  I have been android user until when I was given iphone 12 pro max as a gift.  Ever since that the ease of use and ecosystem have been great for me.  I remember using iphone 7 at work and that time really did not understand why anyone would want to use an iphone 😂

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,One of the things missed in the apps section is the ability to side load apps on Android phones. The iOS app store is notoriously limiting. You can put whatever you want on your Android

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The apple closed ecosystem should be considered a negative
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Android makes it very easy for me to bypass carrier limitations (i.e., T-Mobile's download speed throttling) on video streaming and hotspot usage, and these are high on my list of priorities. It isn't possible to do the same on iOS without jailbreaking the phone. It's a shame, too, as I'd love to swap my Pebble out for an Apple Watch, but I'll probably have to spring for a Garmin something or other instead. I'll add that if you're willing to go through the hassle of installing a custom ROM, you can get effectively indefinite longevity out of any of the more hackable Android phones (e.g., Google Pixel, OnePlus, etc). However, I continue to recommend Apple products to friends and family who aren't very tech savvy as they provide the best experience for people who just want to watch YouTube and browse Instagram without thinking too hard about all the tech in between."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I think in short for tech or phone enthusiast would prefer android more

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I use both systems and I can say that iOS is prettier, but Android is better in productivity and multimedia, that's all you need to know.  In addition, Android adapts more to you.  You can't even cheat on your girl if you're using iPhone because it's not as customizable as Android.  So I ask you... In the end, what do you prefer?  Do you look good or be comfortable? 🤷 

Once a girl told me that iPhones are the best cell phones, but she only knows how to send messages and use TikTok and Instagram so her opinion is not worth much.  😂 Android 🔥"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I've used an iPhone for a year and while I liked the experience, I do not like gestures for stuff like home/back, I like having a back button that I can always trust to be in the same place and do the thing I expect. Sometimes an app on iOS will not have an back gesture and a small button at the top that's hard to reach and too small. Having to constantly switch was tiresome."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android for me honestly. Had both phones but customization is a big thing for me. So android for me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Did you use the same displays they used for the mandalorian as a bg? Or is it just a lot of ambient light reflecting out of your face?🤔
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"“Customisation” in Android is geared towards those who prefer spending a lot of time changing phone settings and how it looks/feels etc aka geeks/ nerds OR those who don’t want to spend more than £200 on a mobile phone. 

iPhone on the other hand is for non nerdy/geeky customers who prefer continuity and ease of use OR those who exclusively live in Apple “eco system”."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"As a student, I see my friends with Iphones (in every class) having to convert photos of homework to jpeg before they can share them across platforms. A small example sure, but for me, apple has never been about ease of use for the consumer. If they were, the apple mouse would have the charging port on the front, not the bottom. The ipad, iphone, and mac would share the same charging ports. They would allow cross platform imessage. The list goes on and on. Just even attempt getting photos off your iphone without using a mac with iphoto. Just try it. It's an absolute nightmare. Apple just cannot win ease of use, while simultaneously winning ecosystem for being closed and controlled. Those conflict. I'm surprised to see that apple was your choice for ""ease of use""."

But for the last 2.5 years, I've been working in the software industry, in a company that makes apps for both Android and Apple. You can basically do anything you want for Android, but Apple is really strict with their rules and you often have meetings with their representatives to make sure you are able to deliver the best user experience possible.

After seeing that, I'm kind of convinced that iOS is a much better, refined ecosystem. Kind of leaning towards Apple for my next phone."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,super powerful smartphone cameras are a gimmick and both apple and android are guilty. most users do not care and cannot tell the difference between any pictures taken with modern smartphones.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I think the bottom line for the last point is that there’s no “android ecosystem”, it’s third parties that create them. Google has only a few products themselves and they abandon them without thinking twice."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Apple pretty much has the US market in a death grip. They have successfully weaponized the well-known tendency of teenagers towards cliqueness, by way of the blue / green bubble thing, in order to insure that pretty much every American under the age of 20 uses an iphone. And since most people don't switch ecosystems, when these people move out into the workplace and go on to live the rest of their lives, most of them will stay in the Apple camp. Outside of the USA though, things are a bit more even. In most of the rest of the ""first world"" nations, Apple and Android use is about 50/50. And then in the third world, Android is king. But back in America, I think Apple will dominate for a long time."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"File management, customisation (hate Android 12 changes) & sideloading for Android. Let alone folding, headphone jack or otherwise love experimentation. It's a music/emu device for me. The iPhone benefits make total sense but I can upgrade/downgrade updates too even if yes general support was the focus.

I don't care about iMessage. Sure the SMS/MMS/RCS thing made sense but I don't care. Also yes Line in Japan or others in other countries makes sense. Sure brands but eh use whatever."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,You can't batch delete contacts on Android without logging into cloud. That's just dumb. It's easy on an Android to merge and organize contacts. Ease of access to Android :)
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Apple is cleaner, probably more reliable and clean easy to use
But I couldn't live without being able to download apps off Google"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Regarding apps, you forgot to mention how you can sideload apps and even root them on Android. I can get an adblocker through an apk easily on my Pixel, but getting one on iPhone is gonna be very difficult. Another thing you should point out is how you can still use apps even if your software is outdated. Android 5+ can run most apps but if you're even still just on iOS 12, you're screwed."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Updates/Support win: Fairphone. 7 years of proven support, & 8 years promised for the new Fairphone 5. The company is even continuing to sell Fairphone 2 parts for those who want to continue using it even though software updates will sunset, & provides reasonable security information about use of an old phone that doesn't get updates."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,No way in hell is apps an iPhone advantage lol. The only reason it’s a priority is because devs will charge like 50% more on android then iOS 😂 shoot android lets you download an old apk and call it a day that’s android all day everyday everything else seems reasonable
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I’m apple now for ease of use and support. My old androids would only get updates for 6 months and then slow way down when the next phone came out… never to get any fixes ever again. That being said the best phone & smartwatch setup I ever had was Pebble with Android. When I switched back to IOS the pebble watch became a brick, nearly all the apps and functions that made it so good were being held back by Apple, and argubly this was the nail in the coffin for Pebble as a company… Apple Watch came out a few months later and it still isn’t as functional of a smartwatch as Pebble was. This is always the achilles heel of Apple, if their cheif product designer doesn’t understand how a feature significantly makes it better the community is stuck with lost potential."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I personally switched to IOS cuz I like the dynamic island too much for the amount it can do. I grew with both systems and I hardly understand that both systems have their pros and cons. IOS laks when it comes to new features. A lot of people laugh when IOS gets ‘new’ shit where as android had it for multiple years. Same as Marques said. It really depends on what features are most important to you and yes, android has more features overall when it comes to having different brands, but iPhone is just simple and not everybody wishes to customize their phone by perfection. As long as it can make phone calls, send messages, make at least some good  (doesn’t have to be best quality) pictures and do Facebook (for most elders) they are fine with a cheaper model, and mostly that will be Android or an older IPhone ."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"You forgot a very important criteria, affordability! Now I have an iPhone, but let me tell you, android offers tons of different phones and devices and they range from very affordable ones, to really expensive ones, this allows people who are struggling financially to have access to the android system, or, if you care about having a certain device that you need to be really good, but another device which doesn't matter that much, you have the freedom to buy an expensive device and link it to a cheaper tablet for example...
The comparison you made is more relevant to people living in the first world where buying a phone is not that big of a deal for how it effects the budget of people, but in many places, a new iPhone can cost what equals a whole year of salary!!"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I think your argument should largely be subjective to the USA cos the narrative is very different in most parts of the world. You can do better..

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"In my days my daily driver was Android and my family uses IOS. Therefore I grew up with both systems by some kind of way. I guess it’s a tie when it comes to which is better. Both have pros and cons and it has to be cuz there needs to be a competition and different brands with their own way to create some phone with certain features for a certain price. My android had a finger reader on the back. Now it’s Face ID. I like both cuz it don’t matter which 1 I use. Getting the phone out of the pocket and my finger is instantly on the back. Or swipe up and you are in as well. This really depends on small details, same with other stuff. You like a fingerprint scanner on the front, go ahead. But you will loose other stuff depending on the phone you get."

And they innovate folding phones cameras curved screens etc. I have an s10+ still and it's an incredible phone even today still lighting fast great screen quality excellent battery life and I use it 24/7 for work and entertainment I watch movies and TV on my phone it's the device I use most.

You used 1% exceptions to imply Android has the better features - or more features, which is irrelevant, and makes the concept of features the same as customization. In reality, for the vast majority of users, the iPhone has the superior feature set - with better performance, security, consistency, usability, and thus far more likelihood that features are used (which is why iPhone crushes Android in content creation and consumption). BTW, notice that you didn't list performance and security on your list too... which I guess you considered unfair due to the iPhone crushing Android there too. Excitement too... I understand your point, but seriously, there is never an Android phone that causes buyers to literally line up and camp outside the store for days. Nothing generates excitement like a new iPhone."

With iPhone, you have rock-solid Airdrop, which only works with other Apple devices but works insanely well

I went and got an iPhone because I love the design and have a Windows laptop. A Shortcut makes file transfer still very easy tho"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Yes, but how much androids have access to that features, 🤷‍♂️
So I'll say is ios have more features since all ios devices have that features 🤷‍♂️"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I still would use android anytime it's just what I'm used to using
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"can you please let me know what is the name of the iphone stand that you showed, that you turn the iphone to portrait mode"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Software updates are not the same on android and iphone. In case of ios there is one big update that updates everything. Also older iphones don't get a lot of features. In case of android there is project mainline which means a lot of components and apps are updated by google from the play store regardless of android version. This means that older phones still get some features. One example is Nearby share which older devices also got. Android has gotten way better with updates. A lot of flagships offer at least 4 years of security updates.

- Majority of the population can't afford to have 'Ecosystem' of either Apple or Android

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Talking about updates, I feel like iOS updates are really minor updates compared to Android updates. The os update changes on iOS are like app updates on Android. But the security patch update is commendable."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"All of you, and especially Marques, do not understand the main difference between Apple and Android.
The iPhone is only for rich people in rich countries, period! For iPhone, you have to have good and high speed Internet to work with iCloud, AirDrop, etc., you need the entire Apple ecosystem, including MacBook, Apple Watch or iPad, to comfortably work with the same file system.
And I'm not talking about the price for the iPhone itself and prices for repairing services or prices for the Apple accessories."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Android all the way. I rather not use a phone for a day then having to use an IPhone for a day. I remember when iphone X came out i thought it looked nice so I gave Iphone a try and after 5 minutes I hated the IOS software and return to to Best Best the very same day. Gave me a headache, never again would I ever use an Apple product. I ❤ Samsung Galaxy phones"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Thanks for making this video. As an Android user I'm constantly attacked. I had an iPhone for several years, iPad, MacBook Pro, Air, etc. and I personally prefer the customization abilities, features and the Samsung ecosystem over an iPhone at this time. But I bring this up because I feel like it's becoming a problem and yet another way to stigmatize people. If folks understood more about each phone, and therefore what they're talking about when approaching an Android user, I think it's a win win for everyone."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,You mean IOS vs Android..I guess...
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I understand that the video was about the Stock experience from both OS. 

But I really missed Marques didn't talk/mention about custom thing that we have on Android Community, like Custom ROMs, that expand the lifetime of one device and Custom Launchers, in customization."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iPhone >. Customization is useless if you own an android ur not it
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Honestly, as an iPhone user that was previously on Android for all of my phones, I think that both are powerhouses in their own right. It ultimately comes down to what YOU want and not what others think of you. I got bored on Android because I was so used to it but I also think iPhone users should try Android at least once. I LOVE my iPhone 14 Pro Max. I find myself in marvel at how amazing the ecosystem is with my M2 MacBook Air, AirPods Max, and my AirPods Pro 2nd Gen. It’s the little things in iOS that blow me away, whereas on Android I always felt like I was in a Ferrari that was limited by regular roads. I do miss certain things about Android (such as the Samsung cameras at times) but iPhones feel more premium and integrated to me."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The best phone is and will always be the one that covers your needs as a user

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"As an iPhone user I agree that the continuity and seamlessness of Apple's ecosystem is great, but  Android still has the best feature: the ability to install apps remotely on a laptop on the playstore."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"There are really only 2 real reasons I use Apple: 1) privacy and 2) the ecosystem that allows for seamless workflow (like I can cmd+C on my MacBook to copy and then tap ""paste"" on my iPhone—never thought I'd ever need that feature but now I use it all the frigging time), and also data transfer/backups, tracking/remote erasing lost devices, etc. That being said, I NEVER get excited to get a new iPhone, even if it's been years since I got a new one (I use iPhones until they're dead). They're pretty much exactly the same except with a few things changed every new device. I'm basically just switching out an old black rectangle for a new black rectangle. However, I DO get excited about new OS UPDATES or a new OS generation (as long as it's still compatible with my device) because that's where I see all the major changes and improvements in features.

TLDR: I just want a phone with good privacy and seamless workflow. Don't care about customization. Hence, I use iPhone."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Happy to see Pixel 8 line bringing 5 years of major updates. PS when talking about ecosystem as both iPhone and Pixel user, Pixel is catching up with the ""ecosystem"" devices and integration, yet I even see it more as a plus on Android because of freedom and compability with other products and hardware."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Hi Marquez interesting video, personally to me the ecosystem part of Android is not just that the same company makes things that work together, android has always been the open ecosystem, that through the openness of the system  I can have a bose speaker, use Spotify, run on Google cloud for work, Microsoft office, have a Samsung TV, a pixel watch etc and everything works together so well, whereas with iOS you can have lots of apple stuff work together but the second you go outside of it it all falls to pieces, it becomes super hard for instance to use a non iOS keyboard, or to connect to a Samsung TV for instance for to hook up to Alexa systems, or run Amazon fire TV etc. I know most people don't want this, they get a Mac and an iPhone and it works together but it does the same with Android, annoyingly with the exception that it is hard to take videos and send them to a Mac, but that is in Apple not a limitation of the technology. Also for ease of use for me, and admittedly I'm not the typical user, I find Android so much easier to use, cause I can customise, spend an hour or so seeing it up to my work flow and life once rather than not having to set up but every day, every time I use something I make a compromise over that workflow"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Apple still got NO foldables, no Flips,.. Amy be a cool factor category
And on other side, who are not in the US, we would have to buy Lot of other apple products to be in the ecosystem
Finally, one other category, The BUDGET, Android phones are available frok 5k to 150k, while apple starts from min 70k. ( the max selling category isn 15k - 25k in India), the Apple is more of a STATUS SYMBOL here!"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"As a Mac and Android user in Argentina, this is my take.

I don't really care about the ecosystem. No one here uses neither iMessage or FaceTime. In fact, it's considered bloatware.

The calculator app on the iPhone is the worst app ever made. You can't even see the calculation you are doing! You only see the last number you input... You don't even see the operator you entered... Of course you don't have history. It's lame.

But the worst part of an iphone it's the notification management. I can't believe there's no icon indicator in the status bar telling you about a notification. I know there's the notification number on each app... But if it's not an app you have on your main screen you can easily miss it... And let's be straight, how many people do you know that have 43819 unread emails? How can these people tell if the got a new email?? Yes I know there's the locks green and the notifications pull down... But every iphone owner I know has it absolutely flooded with random old notifications.

And this is coming from a15 years Mac user... But android has much better ""ease of use"" imo.

There's more stuff too... But I don't wanna get in too deep. Autocorrect on the last word before sending... The ""back"" and ""home"" gestures are just better on Android... Volume controls, etc."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I have an Android phone and an iPhone so to be honest it depends on how you use your phone, needs etc name it they both are useful and unique in their own way so imo"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,You need to give Samsung 1 point since at one point it seems you’re comparing Apple Vs Samsung.

But, I thought on other things that would be closer, or simpler in iOS.  Notification are pretty lousy, alarm clock and widget plainly suck, more clicks.  But, however, for some users iOS is good and easy.  More flexible, easier, faster."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I like how you bring the discussion between these both systems, totally agree, and unfortunately  always facing the issue of which one is better with others LOL. thanks for been objective here."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Disagree on apps because of integration. Because of Apple’s walled garden, third party accessories become severely limited.

Great video though"

I tried Apple for a little bit , even love my MBA , but couldn't stand the iphone 12 pro max. Overheating issues , having to do things the apple way and the very closed eco system just killed it for me. Loved the security and privacy focus , but not enough to put up with the iphone. Really wish my MBA played nice with android phones , but it didnt so my new laptop is a windows machine. Loved the video tho !!"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"In general a very good take on that, especially with the possibility to give priorities and therefore get your own winner. But there are a few points missing. 
For apps, one big disadvantage IOS has is you can't install apps which are not from the App Store. That means for example as Epic Games doesn't agree with some policies of the Apple App Store they aren't available in it and it means no game of them is available on any IOS device. They are not in the Play Store as well but I can still use them and that is only one example. Another point is, in Europe priorities are different than in the US and here especially smaller companies they do update or develop apps for Android first as there are way more users. And they don't have the capacity to develop both at the same time and it's not worth for the few Iphone users. Also many developers in Europe are completely against Apple, bc somethings are more complicated and especially way more restricted. On an Android with a few taps you are in developer settings and can change anything. Or you simply copy an .apk file on an Android device and install it and boom it works. 
Second point is the update situation. While IOS might still win, it is a lot closer than said in the video, bc Android has one big advantage over IOS. Even after an Android device doesn't get security patches you still get updates for every App and therefore still get security updates inside an an app as well as the newest features. Also you get every update from the Google Services in the background without even noticing it and therefore quite big securty improvements although your phone doesn't get the classic security patches. The reason is because these are all more or less completely independent from the Android version you are using. On the other hand if you have an Apple devide which doesn't have the newest IOS version you don't get updates for your apps and therefore no security updates at all after this point. Also then apps simply won't work anymore. Another point is that Apple doesn't guarantee you how long you get updates, while most manufacturers from Android devices do. Google for example does guarantee 5 years of updates for the pixel devices, the possibility that it will get security patches even longer is there. But as Apple usually does give you updates even longer also without a guarantee I would still give the win to them, but only very slightly especially as very few people keep there phones or tablets longer than 5 years. 
The last point is the ecosystem. Yes, apple does advertise this very good while most Android manufacturers do not, but as said in the video Android can do literally anything IOS can. But big advantage and that moves the point here to Android for me and probably many other people is that you can use devices from different brands and even different operating systems as Android does work quite well with windows for example. You may not get every feature between every brand but in general they all work together quite well. So you are not forced to buy products from the same brand which is in case of Apple where at least here in Europe products are very expensive really a big disadvantage and kind of a joke that they more or less do not work with any other device at all and if than its most of the time a solution from the other brand and not Apple. Also as said in the video lets not forget the amount of adapters and accessories you need for Apple devices for example to simply use a projector or connect to a monitor and the different charging cables. You can use a USB-C to charge you Android phone and tablet and your Windows computer or Chromebook. So in general the open ecosystem and the extremely big variety of devices to choose from makes Android win this category for me and should make it a win for everbody who wants to be able to use a device from another brand. Also in Europe communication runs more or less a 100% over Whatsapp or Signal and not iMessage, also iCloud isn't that popular bc of way less iPhone user compared to the US. Also companies here mostly use Windows computers and Android phones very rarely Apple products.
So even without prioritizing certain categories I think it is a slight win for Android for most people especially in Europe"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Apps part is a lie. So you are saying, all iPhones, and all iPads have the same aspect ratio and refresh ratio? Fragmentation is the word that fanboys stopped using after iPhone got 3, 4 new devices per years instead of one."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I think it’s so stupid that people even argue about this. Different people prioritize different things, there is no one “better” product for everybody. I have used both android and iOS back and forth for a number of years and generally find myself gravitating towards iOS, but I have no problem with either. Any modern day flagship device will comfortably do anything you need it to do, we should really stop making such a big deal about who uses what, who really cares?"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Should anyone talk about iPhone 14 Pro battery problem? Someone getting fast degrading battery health and someone (me) fast degrading battery percentage. In idle mode it just literally drop to 88%. 12% bettery charge loss in 6 hours in idle mode is something intriguing. N.B= AOD is turned off

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"How interesting that the ecosystem is the category to weigh this in favor of Apple. I can totally understand your point, but for me it is exactly that same ecosystem that is keeping me from buying an Iphone. I just don't want to be forever locked into choosing Apple."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"IOS being easy to use is a myth. Been like that for years. One thing is continuity, you are used to the systems, and the other is get a person not used to a phone, and ask them to use it. iPhones are terrible to use. 
Example: try to send a picture via email on Android and iOS. On Android you have at least 3 ways, on iPhone it's so stupid and complicated.
The fact you cannot hide icons on iOS and have that huge mess of icons everywhere, it's enough to say Android are easier"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"really, the app section should've been a draw (1 -1 for both) which would've made it a tie overall - you can download moded apks on android and even get pro apps for free - what about rooted apps. You can play some console games on android with some app modifications - there is just a lot of things with apps that the score shouldn't have just gone to ios like that"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Great Video. Not agreed with the ""apps"" category for the Iphone. That's an easy win for Android. 
Quantity is freedom to choose in most cases. And Is more than double on the android side.
I totally prefer to have more apps to choose than having the latest update for some app a couple of weeks sooner. In most cases latest updates don't make any difference."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Apple's ecosystem is what keeps me away from an iPhone. I can admit that it's very well done but it's so limiting to the user that it feels like Apple is Big Brother and will send an agent around to your house if you dare use a non-compatible device.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"This actually got me curious, do apple users even watch these videos to see what is better?
because majority of apple users will always only buy the next iPhone, then they want the air pods, then they buy the apple watch. 
some will even hate the other options just because they are not apple.

so if most of them are not looking for anything else, would they even watch how other options are or not?"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Focus modes are available on Android as well but more fleshed out on Samsung's!

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Updates are a double-edged sword. I usually just skip them (besides security updates), because generally they just make the device slower. I've noticed this with my Macbook (Apple ruined my MB Pro late 2016 with updates years ago) and the same applies for Android. I just don't bother with updates, there will almost never be features you need anyways, so I think the whole ""support/update"" point is kinda pointless (security updates though, those are meaningful. Can you even get separate security updates on iOS like you can on Android? I doubt.)."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I believe a lot of this rests on what you started with. Probably a very small percentage of people who start out with and get used to one platform will ever see anything in the other platform that is actually compelling enough to make them switch. And so they will die on the hill defending why their platform is better. I don't see better, just different."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I jump from my iPhone 14 Pro Max to my Galaxy Flip ( just got the 5) every few weeks just to ring the changes. I ignore any opinion as to which is best from those who have no used both systems - recently (as they are always updating). I hear from people who have only ever used an iPhone that they think Android is no good. How do they know?? Likewise from Android only users knocking iPhones - until you spend some time in both ecosystems you cannot have a valid opinion... that's how I see it. In all the years I have used both systems I come down (slightly) on the side of iOS
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Android for me. Inexpensive, lots of apps, can install apps from outside, lots of device to choose from and custom rom with root. Love android.

And because it's apparently too much to download Google Duo or some equivalent and I should just get an iPhone so we can facetime. I have multiple friends who if Apple's talked with Andriods, they would switch. But the only thing keeping them locked in is the fact that all their friends have Apples"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"iOS and Android are two distinct mobile operating systems with several differences:

1. **Ecosystem**: 
   - iOS is exclusive to Apple devices, such as the iPhone and iPad.
   - Android is used by various manufacturers, including Samsung, Google, and many others, offering a wide range of device choices.

2. **User Interface (UI)**:
   - iOS has a consistent, sleek, and minimalist UI design across all devices, with limited customization options.
   - Android allows for more customization, with diverse UI designs depending on the manufacturer and the ability to change default apps and widgets.

3. **App Stores**:
   - iOS has the Apple App Store, which is known for its strict review process and curated selection of apps.
   - Android uses the Google Play Store, which has a larger app library but may have more varied quality due to a less strict review process. Users can also sideload apps from other sources.

4. **Hardware Integration**:
   - iOS is tightly integrated with Apple hardware, which can lead to optimized performance and a seamless ecosystem for those using multiple Apple devices.
   - Android is more versatile and can run on various hardware configurations, offering options for different budgets and preferences.

5. **Updates**:
   - Apple tends to release iOS updates for a longer period, ensuring older devices receive updates for several years.
   - Android updates are dependent on the manufacturer, so some devices may receive fewer updates or for a shorter period.

6. **Security**:
   - iOS is often considered more secure due to its strict app review process, limited sideloading, and frequent updates.
   - Android's open nature can make it more susceptible to malware, but Google has implemented security measures, and app permissions are more granular.

7. **Customization**:
   - Android allows for greater customization in terms of home screen layouts, widgets, and default apps.
   - iOS offers limited customization options, mainly changing wallpapers and rearranging app icons.

8. **Voice Assistants**:
   - iOS uses Siri as its voice assistant.
   - Android uses Google Assistant, which is deeply integrated into Google services.

9. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   - iOS devices work well within the Apple ecosystem, but they can be less compatible with non-Apple devices and services.
   - Android devices are generally more flexible and compatible with a wider range of platforms and services.

Ultimately, the choice between iOS and Android often comes down to personal preference, ecosystem allegiance, and specific needs. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, catering to different user preferences and priorities."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Android is definitely better.

Its actually not hard to use,

It let's you customize to moon,

It let's you side load apps,

It has a better file management,

It has more app developers working on it,

You can literally run a virtual machine on it,

It has much less apps have stupid subscription plans...

And many more small things. Small things that make up a big thing.

I wouldn't use an Iphone as a main even if they gave it to me for free. You have almost no freedom in that phone and I believe people use it have Stockholm syndrome."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The question is very difficult but you’ll try at your best. 

One only thing if I can: ios17 and ios16 support 5 years of major updates that summarize in 6 years of updates with last os version (iPhone XR, exited on 2018, will have ios17 updates until the end of 2024 that is 6 years) but If we check last years we can see that we have at last one more year of security patches with previous os version, that is we can have a 7 years of supported patch releases. With ios15 we had 7 years of updates with last os and one more for security patches (that is 8 years total). With ios12 we had patches for 10 years (even if in last years we had patches released very seldom).

So Apple has not a fixed  stable patch updates policy even if it is, in practice, very long (surely more than Android)."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is just a waste of money and an apple with a bite to show off.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,How about the Pricetags!?!
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I use both an iPhone and a Samsung together. iPhone is easy to use for work because it pairs really well with my mac and ipad and it makes work a lot easier. On the other hand, I use my Samsung phone with my watch for active stuff like swimming workouts and other exercises and it's also where I listen to music with the buds and it works well with my TV and other appliances and basically all other non-work stuff. I personally think, just basing on my experience with both, if someone were to choose just one; the best device is decided by which house you live in. If you live in ""House Apple"" then the iPhone is best for you, if you live in ""House Samsung"" then a Samsung phone is best for you."

For us android is like Toyota, Great of the average man!!! i believe Africa, Asia & South America prefer Android ,The USA and Europe are the only iOS pickers ( winning in a small margin). so bruh i suggest you make your perspective a little wider."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Macbook Pro. that was my turning point. There is no competition from a provider that can also compete in the smartphone category. So samsung doesnt have a laptop to compete. If you have a macbook then the iPhone ecosystem features along with airpods and watch are unmatched.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"U got it wrong on APPs , there are tons of Android apps which can help you customize your phone totally, activate certain settings with one click for example, or add tons of non-stock visuals , like circles around the front camera , different battery percentage indicators etc. I mean, u could not really give it to the iPhone given the fact that there are so many useful 3rd party apps for Android, it's not even a competition.."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"One point you left out in the Apps section is that Android actually easily allows to install non-Playstore apps with .apk files. That widens their ecosystem even further.
Also, during the time where I still used an iPhone, Apps used to cost more on the AppStore than in the PlayStore, which is also a W for Android. While I agree for the majority of your app-assessment, you left these aspects out..."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I think one of the problems, is that there are a gazillion different Android phones, and almost as many Android flavors and handset device manufacturer customizations.  So comparing iOS and Android is intrinsically problematic."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,On thing to put in mind. Would you still buy apple phones if it uses android than ios?  The point is people buy apple gadgets beacuse of the brand itself. Why do people call iphone when you can call it a phone/cellphone? Would you call samsung for a samaung phone? Of course not.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,When it comes to the updates/support....even though the latest iOS is supported back 5 generations....new iPhone users look down upon the XR users
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"When I saw the ""ecosystem"" as the last point, I was sure that the score would be brought to 3:3 and then the iPhone would ""win"""
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Apple is by far the winner for me since 2019.  This comparison is also a bit unfair as it is like comparing Tesla vs. all other electric cars in the world from all manufacturers.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I predicted every single point and the outcome as soon as I saw the categories.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I know you are in the US but also availability is a huge factor outside the US. I was a stock Android user for a few years and always got Google phones back since Nexus 4 when I switched from iPhone and never regretted it until two years ago when I was struggling to find Google phones in Spain. For some unknown reason, Google has this policy that they do not release the phone on every market like Apple does. I got really tired of chasing the Google phone everywhere and switched back to iPhone."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The problem with these kinda debates or comparisons is that iOS is used by one company, whereas Android is used by hundreds of companies. Most of the Android versions you get on most Android phones are heavily baked/modified to fit their phone. So bit of a silly discussion really. If anything, its shocking that Apple is able to win at any category."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Facetime?, I message? I'm good with Viber and Whatsapp.🤷"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Apple is for durability and simplicity nothing else.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"For me customization it's one of the biggest factors, because i get bored of my setups very often. Also sideloading modded apps like revanced and so on is a must because i hate ads and will do everything in my power to get rid of ads everywhere. Last thing is file browsing system because i like to set up and use folders and subfolders the exact way i like. That's why I've been Samsung guy for a very long time.
Also, i like how he pointed out that the ecosystem works only in the US market because outside of the US, apple stuff is way way weaker"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,What apps do you use that are seamless for a 2 phone user?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,IOS period for me. Most scammers will target android with virus apk file.  Cos its easy to install.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"This was a fantastic tutorial,, however, I need a phone that I could still connect to the network with in low signal areas and Apple doesn’t cut it. Android is the winner with that. thanks for the great breakdown!!"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Yeah but the apple ecosystem costs a ton of money, same as with their garbage tablets, PCs and laptops that get wasted in a couple of years"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I think durability should be on that list it matters a lot to me.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Back in the day, when I was a lil technology sprout i loved the freedom of customization Android offered and still offers but as I grew older i realized that less is more and i just want the thing to W O R K hahah. I think apples approach to customization this last few years is perfect. Its meaningful enough to offer some customization but not out there enough to have you accidentally make your device vulnerable for no reason. We hardly ever hear ppl talking about jail-breaking the iOS nowadays and i think thats great. For me, i just want to pick a nice pic for my lockscreen and background, select some useful widgets, maybe a nice font and that's it. Nowadays the thing just needs to work properly and not fall appart on me. I can't afford having my device bricked or failing to do the shit i need it to do with my work schedule lmao."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Both are winners... you need to change that perspective..I dint watch the video

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,to be exact if u do this comparations living outside of Europe and the US u will find android phones working better than iphones so if u can can u do a video about it pls  @mkbhd
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"It's great to see that my knowledge isn't totally out of date now I'm an old. I always remember recommending iPhone to less proficient technology users who just want stuff to work when they click the button. Their priority is ease of use, apps and ecosystem (for familiarity and recognisability of apps and features). On the flip side I want customisation and features so I've always gone with Android. Sounds like that hasn't changed in the 4 or 5 years it has been since I felt the need to buy a new phone, or was asked to help someone else pick one."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"In other words, Apple’s about Apple, whereas Android’s about YOU ! 🤔"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"This might sound ridiculous,
 i have an iphone and a flip and i feel the iphone is like a Toyota it just keeps working so if i am buying a new phone every 4-5 years i had go for an iphone ."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I have been an Android fan my whole life. However one of my most prominent hobbies is photography. I can’t stress enough that the color accuracy on iPhones is a MASSIVE selling point. As much as I love Android phones I can’t trust any photo that I edit on my Galaxy phones. The screens tend to be over saturated -great for content consumption but terrible for content creation.- For this reason alone I am basically forced to use an iPhone. The day that Samsung or Google releases a flagship phone with 95%+ color accuracy I’m going back to where my heart lives but until then islets iPhone for me.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,One cannot simply rely on iOS. Gotta have an android as secondary.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Let me put it this way: Hundreds vs. APPLE

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Most people use majority of the top apps. Not sure how apple gets he award for it. Same thing for ease of use and ecosystem, they are both exactly the same. You can get stock out of the box and use it without changes and it will be easy to use. 

If you are not tech savvy and you use non major branded android phone then you might struggle to tech support from your IT family member because they're not aware of feature x that's been implemented differently on the non major branded phone. 

Also, the walled garden and lock in should be criteria: if you want choice, and not get locked into a design choice then android wins that category."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The real winner is the friends we made along the way 🙂
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Used both platforms daily and have been a long-time (since the early Android days, G1 user). For me, Apple emerges as the winner due to its longevity, top priority on security, emphasis on user privacy, consistent update support, optimization for speed, and most importantly, as a software developer for both platforms, an unparalleled ecosystem support. As a software developer, iOS is by far the best with unmatched compatibility and support compared to Android for devices. Most of of team spends 10x longer fixing backward compatibility issues for older devices."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Marcus please make a video comparing instagram or snapchat cameras of iPhone and Android. Apparently, the stories and photos in these apps sucks on Android when compared to Apple."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I don’t like the fact that you have to put your iPhone up to your laptop just to have a good camera on a call.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Let me put clear here.  #1 reason to get a device or OS or whatever you want to call it, is not how much you can customize it, not who came out with things first.  APPS! Is the #1 thing people use on any device.   You can have a great phone but if the apps are shitty and not prioritized, it’s crap.  Same for support on your $1k devices.  I’m sorry but Apple/iphone/iOS wins it across all the board.  Which billionaire or multimillionaire or just normal busy person wants to deal with crappy apps, and no support if something goes wrong?   I don’t have time to spend on customizing a phone.  Not even going to start if you have kids and the control you have over them."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The real winner is both of them cuz' they get our money for their hot garbage. We as consumers always on the losing side.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,2 key problems with iOS in my opinion is when you are doing heavy-duty processes the minute you switch to another app iOS or iPadOs will kill the app. I don't know if Apple resolved this with the m1+ ipads. The second one is iPhone not with USB C which should be resolved this year.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I feel you totally slipped over sideloading in the apps category. Side loading is THE main reason I use android. I barely use it but it's saved my back a couple of times. To sideload on iOS you have to jailbreak.. For me missing sideloading is a huge issue.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I totally agree with this, with one specific remark, which of course is just my opinion. Looking at Android as a whole, picking out Samsung specifically for their ecosytem is a bit wonky. Android's strength is multiple manufacturers, but it also divides the platform. So the Android ecosystem (not just Samsungs' ) ends up weaker. Although that's not really the correct terminology here. For me, personally, I like them both for exactly the reasons mentioned in this vid. 🙂"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,What about price?????? that should be part of the analysis
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Price, screen quality, photo quality, batterylife.... all kinda important as well :P 
Anyway, I have said this many times before, but I'll say it again: ""official"" updates matter far less on Android phones. Because they work differently. Google sends important security updates through the Play services platform, which happens for a period of time far longer than even Apple's iPhone updates. Apps get updated seperately, unlike on the iPhone where, for instance, if your browser is out of date, you're out of luck because it only gets updated when the OS itself is updated. So when important security updates get pushed to your device for a very long time and your apps always stay up to date, who cares which Android version you're running? It's not as important as people think. And then when you take pricing into consideration..."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"iphone's UI is just bad, literally the worst. For starters, when typing words, you cannot edit the word, the cursor cannot be moved between the alphabets of a word, you have to clear and type the word again. We indians most of the time type some native language words in english alphabets, iphone cannot learn these either, as compared to android in this regard, apple completely sucks. to go back in an app, you need to find the 'back' button everytime in every different app. And the calulator is just worst, it does not even show the calculation you are performing, let alone the history of calculations performed. What is the use of calling this a smartphone? Even the call logs are limited to the point that they are useless. And sharing data with others is a pain. Even the share button needs to be rediscovered every time in every different app. Anything apart from calling is designed to be difficult. I am seriously surprised how it can be this bad, when they have so much resources."

It started lagging after three software updates which the company promised me. It was a Realme 6 Pro. Now, when i switched to Iphone 14 Plus, the app downloads, the contact transfers and the camera AI that makes the images look like its clicked on a DSLR (I own one so i know the quality and the difference). I do miss the editing softwares that were on my android nd also the customizations that i used to make but still being the long lasting phone like ios, I prefer this over iphone cause all I need is to chick good professional looking photos and makes a phone call or watch reel nd chat on whatsapp."

oh also if you don’t admit android is shitware you don’t know what android is 😂

The main things I care about are ease of use, ecosystem, updates and the ability to get my phone serviced easily when something goes wrong. For me, iPhone does this. I’ve owned Android before and I very much enjoyed it but I stick with iPhone for the reasons listed. I want it to work perfectly out of the box without a lot of effort from myself, I want it to connect to all my other Apple devices and I want consistent security updates since security and the safety of my data is something I’m often concerned about. I will say I don’t understand the need from some people to have iMessage. I’d be okay whether I had that or not. As long as I can still text people what does it matter?"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android is way to much customized. Xiaomi for example has it own app installer that makes software more complex to implement with and more buggy.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,This is stupid comparison in so many ways
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Why don't we talk about price & expandable memory. How many people can really afford a iphone. In India just for that  reason android is king

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,It's 2023 and you still can't organize your own damn homescreen on iOS !
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Price should also be considered. Android has an advantage in affordability of older devices (new or used). A 2-3 year old Samsung flagship would cost two times cheaper than a 2-3 year old iPhone here in Ukraine

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"To be candid, I've been using an iPhone for the past two years after using a Huawei P30 Pro for three years. One notable issue I've encountered with the iPhone is that it doesn't quite serve as a ""one-stop solution"" for all my needs. For instance, when I used my Android phone for activities like skiing, I could easily export videos from my GoPro and Insta360 cameras and transfer them to an external SSD connected via USB-C, all with just my phone. Unfortunately, this isn't possible with the iPhone.

Furthermore, I've noticed that some applications I relied on when I had my Android phone are not available on the iPhone. For instance, I used a transmission client application and a Kodi remote control app called Yatse, which I can't find equivalents for on the iPhone. It seems that while the iPhone works well for the majority of users as a phone, for people with specific needs like mine, it still lacks several essential features for which I can't find suitable alternatives. To fulfil all my needs I must be sure that I always carry a laptop with me :( ."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"What about dual app support. So, in app category, Android should have taken the win. And also, some major aaps which are not basically used in US are also not supported in iOS."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,My iPhone typing doesn’t seem as good as my pixel.  My only gripe.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,You could’ve added cost as a category. I think that was more important

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"since day 1 when it was Nokia 5800/N97 (named iphone killers) vs Iphones, I went to Symbian (Nokia, Sony, Samsung, many others)  because they had better cameras and bluetooth transfer and you could easily side load applications by just installing an_app.sis (now an_app.apk) without need for root or jailbreak iphone. Those same features were inherited by Android. iphones are expensive which is key factor that was missed in this review, COST buying/ownership, you can get all android features with new 100$ device. I never needed facetime by using many other alternatives (WhatsApp, zoom, messenger, google voice, and so many others). so clear winner for me is Android (Samsung A52 5G since Jan 2022)"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I just want people to understand the IPhone is never yours Apple forces you to do what they want buy what they want used only they products and apps at the end make your phone slow not working properly so you be forced to change to the new one with the same feature same apps 🧠 oh my gosh and list keeps going but they are good phone for United States of America

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"- Customization: Android
- Features: Android
- Apps: Apple (this is clearly APPLE)

- Excitement: Android (because ANDROID has many lines & brands, so each brand will definitely provide surprises & attractive offers)
- Updates: Apple (this is obvious, but Samsung is trying to do their best, so we'll see)
- Ease of Use: Android (I know there are a lot of advertisements for the ANDROID smartphone line, but it still sells well for the ANDROID market in Indonesia because the price of the goods is relatively cheap, so whatever the condition of the ANDROID, as long as it's cheap and can be used for communication & playing games, it's okay.)
- Ecosystem: Android (I know the ecosystem from APPLE is extraordinary, but not many Indonesians want to buy all products from APPLE such as Macbooks, iPads, iMacs, Aipods Pro/Max, Airtag, sometimes they only buy iPhones but their laptops are Windows.)
The winner is: ANDROID.

Personally, since I live in ASIA (Indonesia), this is based on what I see, I apologize if we have a different POV but we only see APPLE as a Luxury product on the other hand, ANDROID (Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Realme, Poco, Pixel, etc) is an ""affordable product or functional product. On average, people who buy APPLE products buy more iPhones. 

That's why APPLE hasn't opened an APPLE Store in Indonesia, because APPLE's appeal is only in the smartphone line, even though APPLE has a multitude of product lines that can be sold.

On the other hand, for ANDROID, the purchasing power of Indonesian people is still relatively low, which means, on average, people prefer cheaper smartphones with good performance, That's why there are many smartphones such as XIAOMI, POCO, OPPO, VIVO, IQOO, REALME, offering low prices but it provides performance, especially in playing games, is quite good."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,You could have unified the App & Updates category and added a Price category instead which would have had Android come out the winner. Even in the US price is a huge factor in deciding whether to upgrade or not. The fact you can buy an android phone from $200 to $2000 suits anyone's budget.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Support should not be just about software, hardware support and repairability should have been included as well. With a lot of android devices, getting an after market screen or a battery is pretty easy, cheap and it greatly increases the life of a device. For that has been key with all the devices I have owned. How easy and cost effective is it to fix a device 2 years or maybe 3 years after I have bought it. With Apple devices, given their popularity and standards, it could've been an easy victory in this regard, but their approach towards making this very thing difficult just baffles me."

I even have google photos in my iPad because all my photos are in google photos. You could just login to your gmail and access all your photos, google drive documents, keep notes, docs and spreadsheet, all in any browser you have in whatever computers available. Let every app be a web base app!"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"For Customization, something that I always didn't like about iOS was app notifcation sounds.

Unless if the developer of said app built in the ability to change the notification sounds to something custom, you absolutely cannot do this on iOS. You only get the basic Tri-tone or other basic ""Apple sounds"".

Of course, this is excluding jailbreaks. Which obviously isn't for everyone and comes with concerning risks in and of itself."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Multitasking and a ""real"" file management system is what still keeps me on Android. An example: for rendering a video with the app ""splice"" i have to 1.) keep the screen on and 2.) the app in the foreground with apple. On Android? Rendering a 4k vid for an our while making a call, watching videos on YT and texting on Slack is no problem. I can attach a harddrive to my phone, can use it as a computer with any TV in any hotel room etc. Android can be a workhorse while IOS is for consumption. And this is no Apple basing - I love my macbook, my mac mini and my iPad. it´s just that the iphone is overpriced af for its capabilities.
And then there´s a dedicated standardized back button (what a guesture mess on an iphone)...but I disgress...."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about costs as a factor?
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Dude , I did move to iPhone last year and really I couldn't keep up with this shitty af OS named iOS, Honestly there are tons of little annoying things that iOS does that really effects the usability for one who used android for whole of his life, like
1. The absence of a universal back button, and
2. Not being able to download or run stuffs in background, seriously dude it's a shame a flagship phone in 2023 can't even send like 100 WhatsApp photos in background; the moment you go back to home it stops sending photos , 
3. lack of customization 
4.The lack of a proper file system,
5. The notifications are a mess in iOS, In a android you basically can choose which type of notifications you wish to get from a specific app, e.g you can opt to receive only important notifications from Amazon and choose to block all their promotional and spam notifications but in iOS you will either get all the notifications or none.
6.Also you can't call record in iOS
7. And for some weird reason iOS only stores record of last 100 calls only, like really ? What's the need of this stupid limitation.

I can list many more but enough of rant for today 😂, because of these reasons, last month I sold my iPhone 13Pro max and got a S23 Ultra only after 11 month of using it.
And honestly can't stop myself but to adore how good of a phone S23U is . I would never get a iPhone again atleast not for next 4-5 years."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I have to contradict your statement of app development. As a developer from Europe, I can tell that here Android app updates are always prioritized over iPhone app updates. First of all, there are more Android users than iPhone users. And secondly - ask any developer about the release process for Android vs iPhone. In Google Play, it is so much easier and fluent, while for AppStore, it is a nightmare. There are so many hurdles, rules, checks, validations... and you have no guarantee how long it will take. If you are targeting a specific release date, for Android it's easy to achieve. For iPhone, it is impossible."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Only Apple ✅
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"1. Fun fact my elderly parents hate apple and love android for the ease of use
2. apps suck, what developers don't tell you that that developing for iOS costs money while for android is not, so if we talk about not US than android is better and don't forget that apple is not in every country, but I bet that there are at least 1 android phone seller 
3. ecosystem sucks, because it takes away the freedom. If mentioned samsung, so mention that galaxy buds will work with every other phone as well as watch, while apple stuff is very poorly work with android. Meaning that 'walls' around the eco also a dealbreaker for me
 and killer feature is connect your phone via USB to any freaking thing on a planet, if saved my performance multiple times 

Actually there's a very-very simple question that you need to ask to choose apple or andoird:
ecosystem. If you have windows computer, sony headphones, galaxy watch, and God knows what else, you are out of your mind if you are getting apple. So it just comes down to ecosystem and that' it."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Google can sell the best product but unless they start respecting privacy I choose Apple.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I disagree with Apps being better on IOS.
I have a few friends with iPhones and there were so so many times when I discovered super awesome and powerful apps on Android and those were not present on IOS or were added years later.
So no, in my opinion the app variety it's not better on Android.
Also, you forgot to mention the fact that you can install modded apps on Android. You have Instagram, Spotify, YouTube (and many more) modded apps that add a ton of functionality and fix any ""issues"" you might have had with the stock apps."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The title is wrong. iPhone is well, a PHONE, and Android is an operating system. You should have known better...Don't compare a phone with an operating system. iOS vs Android (The Real Winner)!"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I use both occasionally but prefer iPhone. Because of the camera system (HDR capabilities), and the fact that 99% times things just work from the beginning. In my experience, Android is for tinkerers because of the so-called freedom to customize and such, things often dont work and I have to seek solutions. It's a brain sharpening excercise. Also, my customization experience is that one can spend hours trying to find a nice looking alternative launcher, fonts, icons etc. and then revert to the default anyway because all alternatives are not complete and I can navigate into a corner where the look is crap. There are too many half baked options available and it takes endless hours to sift them through. In iOS, most customization decisions are made instead of me, and I just use them without wasting time."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i really really loved your ending. you make a solid point. I'm Team Android %100 but I respect your point of view because you make really solid statements about each.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"On apps quality is important, but the quantity aspect isn't as much a negative. Android is far more open to sideloading and being open with apps, so you can find a lot more freedom there. This also ties into the ecosystem for Android being more open to small developers and niche products. It's a blessing and a curse, but my HTC One as an example has an IR transmitter, which I can use with certain apps to control a TV or anything that uses IR signals. Not many phones come with that capability, so an app for it doesn't make much sense in the grand scheme of things, but certainly for not paying a hotel extra for the AC. You can't hold the quantity aspect against it without the variety part. With the frameworks provided it also isn't that big a deal to update apps for multiple phones outside of some fringe resolutions or something. In the end those things are less about the operating systems and more about individual hardware and mainstream phones tend to all be the same. Foldable and other fringe stuff doesn't exist in large enough quantities to be a big concern for most developers."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I love deeply customizing my phone, so iPhone has always been a no go for me. I'd maybe get an iPad, but I like my tablet to be more of a computer vs a giant phone, so I go for the Surface in that category."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Airdrop needs to improve reliability.  I have had to restart phones more times than I like to get airdrop to work.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"From an ease of use side of things....i actually completely disagree. When picking up and navigating the phones i find the iPhone to be SOOOOO unintuitive. But that's also a super subjective thing.

Edit. The main problem you DIDN'T mention with the ""ecosystem"" category....and should reverse the result even on your own logic....is that the ""apple ecosystem"" ONLY works if EVERYTHING you own is apple. As soon as apple products start needing to cross over with other technologies....it becomes a mess. Where as ANY Android ecosystem will pretty much integrate with any other Android product pretty seamlessly."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"IMO, people are more excited about the upcoming iPhone in general. The rumours begin to pop up for the next iPhone from October itself. Almost every week there is a new rumour about iPhones/Apple and let's not talk about the lines outside the Apple Store when the new iPhone launches. It's September now and we have few rumours about S24 and as of now we have a lot more rumours about iPhone 16 already 😅

Yes, Androids do have a lot of diversity but that doesn't mean it's more exciting."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I think the video misses several important things. First of all, I don't know about US but in other countries in Asia and specifically in India no one, uses FaceTime, iMessages etc. apps even if they have an iPhone. Even abandoned apps like Google Duo is used more than FaceTime. 

Secondly, there has to be a definite category of ""price"". At least 80% of the world population will keep this as their first priority. Even if you give a very functionally advanced iPhone (or Samsung Galaxy Ultra models), many will just not buy it for the price alone, as at the end of the day it is just a phone."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"For me android is more value for money for the freedom it gives and the handy features they provide. Yes it was crappy before but now its pretty good. Man the freedom ,storage, form size, fast charging, 120hz is cheap.are what keep me hooked. The new form factor of iphones is uncomfortable and big naah for me."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Kind of surprising that you missed a category that seemingly would be at the top of most people's lists: Performance. I'm not even an Apple fan but I'm pretty sure it would take the prize in that category for almost any comparison test you throw at it. Oh well, otherwise, cool idea for a video :)"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"longevity and price wise, iphone obviously wins."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"highly disagree with ease of use on the iPhone. Repairs are also very easy with android phones compared to the past, with iPhone its almost never practical to repair the phone unless it's a battery replacement and you are never guaranteed data recovery. This is absolutely stupid. 9/10 times you'll walk out of there with a bill higher than the cost of a new iPhone. At this point they're less of service centres and more of just shops. They have more shops period.

Ease of use? Don't make me laugh. There are so many miniscule frustrations with the iPhone if you're not already in an apple ecosystem. The incredibly poor bluetooth implementation for one. Just moving files off your iPhone is tedious. How it pushes iCloud and annoys you to the max from day 0, omg your 5GB is up, delve into settings and turn it off and lose everything. Changing ringtones is difficult, sometimes your phone rings and you have no clue why it doesn't ring. Is the switch on ? Is the volume low ?. Don't even get me started on the dialer, have you even used the dialer ? There's no support for numpad search dialing. You have to manually search your contacts which is such a weird 2 step process to have. You can't call recents with a different sim, you have to search it up again in your contacts or manually put in the number if not stored. and dial it with a different sim.

There are so many tiny things, i'm sure people can come up with 100's. Some of these you absolutely can't do anything about even with 3rd party apps due to how limited the OS is."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Won't go to iOS as they don't have the apps.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I was an iPhone proponent for the longest time. I had an iPhone 3GS, 4S, 5, 6, and then my last was the 6S which I kept until 2019! Where Apple lost me as a consumer was the removal of the headphone jack, but the constant updates kept me on iOS even though I wasn't into the rest of their products (especially Mac OS, bc I simply don't like it at all). When I started to notice my 6S slowing down, I made the jump to Android with the Galaxy S10+ since OneUI looked like a great blend of iOS and Android. It felt weird for about a week, but I fell in love with the freedom it gave me to do basically whatever I wanted. I always thought that ease of use was super important, but being someone who was into building custom PCs, this stopped making sense when I ran into problems sideloading apps on iOS. I naively believed Samsung wouldn't follow Apple's decision to drop the headphone jack due to their marketing at the time, but I quickly realized it wasn't THAT big of a deal. Then I made the decision to try the Z Fold 3, as I felt folding phones had matured enough, and I loved the flexibility (no pun intended lol). The Z Fold 4 resolved a lot of my complaints about the 3 as well (the 5 was disappointing though). If you have any sort of technical troubleshooting ability and are curious about Android, I HIGHLY recommend Samsung phones. They even have an Easy Mode that gives a very iOS-like experience. You can also get great trade-in values for your phones using some workarounds so you don't pay anywhere near flagship prices, and even keep your old phone should you not like the new one and want to return it within the time period given. Basically, find the highest trade-in value Android phones, search for some used ones at a price much lower than the offered value, and boom! Profit. The only downside is resale value, because people simply don't value older Android phones that much (hence why my workaround is viable). Samsung's Smart Switch makes the transfer from iOS super simple, but you will not get everything like paid apps, sorry. (Google Opinion Rewards is a great way to avoid paying for any apps since they pay you for answering simple surveys) If you have any questions about moving from iOS to Android, just ask!"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I'm likely weird on this, but the lack of customization was a plus when I switched from Android to iPhone. I was deep in the Android customizing rabbit hole, custom ROM's and kernel tweaking and everything. I spent tons of time adjusting my phones, trying to get it exactly perfect only to dump it all and start fresh a week later because something new dropped. I never felt fully satisfied because there was so much to try. I never really USED my phone that much, I just messed with it.

Then I tried out an iPhone. Figured out the OS, tweaked a few settings, and...I was good. It didn't bother me that I couldn't adjust every minute detail to fit my liking. I actually DO stuff with this phone, it isn't an unfinished project that I've yet to make use of as a smartphone. 

So yeah. People with control issues might find that useful."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Only one I disagree with is apps (so far) and only because the crux of the point is ""people prioritize updating Apple apps"" which is just a cliff note of the previous point. I'd say the fact that ""there's an app for that"" as a concept for Android far out ways the developers preference of updating efficiency. Apps are all about ability of use, and Android smashes Apple in that regard."

I can concede that the quality of Tier-2 apps would be better on Apple, but the ability for me to sideload apps and use alternative app stores is huge. On Android, I'm able to install sideload apps or specific versions of apps if I so choose - even without Google's blessing. I can't do that on Apple."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I'd argue that an aspect of the Apps category that was missed is the level of integration third party apps can have. This is partly a crossover with the Customisation category, with the ability to change the default dialler, SMS app, navigation app, etc, but also the ability for apps to integrate with each other. When an iPhone user saw for example the way that calls, texts and media playback are integrated into Google Maps navigation on Android, they were very impressed. I imagine there are other similar examples."

I cant use a device thats not being patched. 100% reason I use iOS over Android. Apps for Tablet and Fold devices in the Android ecosystem are typically phone apps scaled vs dedicated tablet apps for iOS and so many apps in iOS made for Android work better on iOS, smoother. I dislike the bloat in Android, similar to Windows. I realise you can remove it, but I shouldn’t need to. Ask me if I want it and when I say no, thats it."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Someone might have already mentioned this, but im gonna give a big biiig disagreement to the ""ease of use part"". As someone who has used both OS's, worked in phone retail, selling and helping out with support - i know first hand how god awful Apple is when you have f'ed yourself.. forget one password, and dont have access to another decice or have another email registered with Apples system already? ""Ups sorry, you have to recover the whole phone and delete all."" Now, considering how many older people use iPhones because family says; it'll be easier for us to help you, and; oh iPhone is so easy to use. Yes... it is, if you are younger, understand phones and tech better, have other devices, and have been around the block before. Or are into their ecosystem in a bigger way then many are.

 With Android, you have most likely been promted to set up ""two factor ID"" earlier. But Apple counts on you having a second Apple device as the ""first choice"". Which is so arrogant. Or, you might be able to make a new password just by creating a new email and use that as the ""new password reciever email"" when faced with this problem with Android. 

Iphones are easy to use if you know what you are doing, so you know not to fuck that one specific thing up. Their obsessive need for  password remembrence is anti consumer, for all consumers that aren't as well adept. It is so god damn hard, to only own ONE Apple device, and they capitalize on that. 

Hope you read this small rant and maybe it breathes some thought into this whole topic. Love your videoes, keep it up! :)"

Outside of the US and Europe Android has a much larger market share. And that comes down to the hardware and ecosystem. USB is huge. But also so many more hardware options. iPhones in general are more expensive. But there are some very cheap Android phones out there. It's going to be the only thing you can afford if you lack cash.

I LOVE the customization and now feel like I am in a prison when using an iPhone. I can make the phone look and behave the way I want it to, not how some engineer in Cupertino wants it to act and look like. Updates? Never had any issues. Speed and fluency? My S22U is a beast. No lag. The screen is awesome, it has USB-C and I will not have to buy proprietary cables like I would with this year's iPhone. I can text my iPhone friends just the same. Heck, if I want a blue bubble I can make it that color, at least on my end. IPhone users can't. Lol. I can use any default app I want and not tied to Apples' map app or any other app. There are plenty of great apps on the Google Play store. I even use more SPen more then I thought I would and happy it's there. Some of these iPhone users make up stuff. LOL. The reality is that both iPhone and my Samsung phones are both great devices. But I just prefer my Samsung. Looking forward to upgrading in February to the S24U!

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"What I love about android is that it is not closed off to other OS, like if you have a samsung tv, it will easily let you cast stuff from you apple phone, if you are switching from an apple to an android phone, all your stuff is easily transferable, but it's the other way around that it's usually a nightmare, trying to pair non-apple stuff with apple is harder, screen mirroring is harder, file sharing is harder, apple just wants you to use their stuff or leave and that is something that is completely the opposite of androind and I just love that abput android."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"i get more excited about Android phone releases because they are always taking chances with new and interesting features. Apple does this but on a much smaller scale. I say this as an iOS user. The nerd in me wants to see a lot of specs and tech being pushed to its limits but I like my phone to just work, everytime. I never found that to be my experience with Android phones."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Value for money is also a factor. Most people buy iphones not because of ecosystems or features but to show off..
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"In my opinion, Android is a better phone /OS than the iPhone/iOS but the iPhone has a better security system hands down."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im back to android from over a decade of iphones. The main reason? price. In my country you pay over 1200 us dollars for a new iphone 14. So i got a pixel 5 renewed under 250 (iphone 12 was 500 in the same conditions). I thought that i was to feel off the grid going back to android but im quite happy. I still think that for the same price if you get it an iphone is the superior device. But the price is too much at least arround here.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I think ease of use is a very subjective thing. And an important aspect of it also comes down to which platform you started with. I know a lot of people who find IOS extremely complicated to use once they shift from android. I am sure it will be the same case for android. There are stuffs that make both IOS and Android easy and hard to use, and it all depends on what you are working with. So I don't think ease of use being so much of a subjective thing deserves equal weightage to something as objective as let's say customization."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I can’t believe price/value wasn’t a category. This is why Marques is fun to watch but I never take his advice seriously. The guy never talks about value or price because he gets most of his tech free and he’s rich so it doesn’t matter. This is the opposite for your average consumers.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Apps are better on iPhones, really? There are more apps because there's more access to apps on what they can do. Plus there are apps not on the Play Store that just exist as they follow Google's policy, like revanced and many more. This point is Android's 😂"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I disagree on giving the point to apple for the apps, but the rest I agree with. I feel like that claim of the lack of optimization for Android apps is an old idea, at least with regard to big companies like Samsung. I see you showed the optimization issue with the pixel fold in the video, but that isn't even a close representation to what happens most of the time. If you open the same apps that didn't work on the pixel fold, almost every single one works flawlessly on the galaxy fold."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I'm an Android guy, and have been for years.  In my opinion, you can do a lot more with Android than you can with iPhone."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I’ve been selling these phones for almost 10 years and I’m telling you now Apple is dummy proof because most people don’t actually know how to do half the things their phones do nor do they care. I can sell a boomer an iPhone and they will not bother me for the next three months trying to figure out how to work it if they already had an iPhone and transferring information is a million times easier than android for the masses. iPhone just works it’s stamped the same for everybody and it’s dummy proof everything backs up to one account. You don’t need a Gmail and a Samsung account and a Microsoft one account. Just a back up some damn pictures and contacts , you have one account iCloud, also you can’t go in there messing things up which is better for the masses. But if you’re techy and know how to manage your device go with an android. If somebody has problems with her phone, it takes like three things for me to figure out what it is wrong, an android phone. It could be endless trying to figure out what the customer did to their phone. Samsung is the biggest hot mess of an OS I’ve ever seen going from one Samsung to the next one takes hours you can download one shit app and next thing you know Barbara has 10 cleaning apps and 10 solitaire apps that have pop-ups and ads on them and her phone can’t even pick up a phone call without malware popping up from some rogue solitaire game that android lets on its store. Pixel is the closest thing, but Samsung is the worst operating system hands-down. Not to mention the hardware there is iPhone 7 Plus an 8+ is out there working perfectly fine with no issues. I’ve had at least three Samsung 10s come in where they’re just dead ass nines dead ass eights that are slow and the battery is shot. Pixels hardware is kind of junk to. You’ll be lucky to find a running pixel three out there, not many pixel fours either they all took a shit already. not to mention Google is ran by communists so I went from a huge Samsung and pixel fan to. I’m happy with an apple that just works and is going to last me at least five years."

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"For me, i have experience both worlds. And iOS is like a beautiful lie and Android are a customizable propaganda. Android users makes their Android devices look more like iOS and iOS are doing the same past few year. lol"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android phones are better in customization and having good features. The only downside in my opinion would be that android is own by google and it has been known that google collect much more data from users than from apple users.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I still think that you're way too biased towards Apple.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Appstore vs Playstore purchase cost is different in some countries. Which can be major deciding factor for high spenders.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I have both but tbh I use the iPhone as a daily driver outside when I’m commuting. I mostly enjoy my Android at home.

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,You forget you can download apps from google directly onto   an android. Which increases the number further this whole review process doesn't really take into account people with tech intelligence that can do way more on an Android.

Now I’m inclined to buy an iPhone to replace my Samsung s22plus. I would love to say android is better. It would be much cheaper. But the truth is, no it is not."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"If you are going through this analysis you are 80+% of the time going to pick an Android. Not because Android is better, but because this is an engineer's type of analysis, and the vast majority of people that analyze things this way are going to be tech forward, experimental, DIY types, who are mostly going to care about features and customizability more than anything. They are also more likely to use PCs and Linux and other non-Apple products for the sand reason. But they are also a minority of Android users.
Most people care about three things when buying a phone: price, camera, and compatibility. The last thing is most concerned with what you've already got. If you have a MacBook and an iPad and all that, the iPhone is going to be more valuable. If you are a creative you are probably using Apple products because they tend to be much better for art and editing and things like that, so they are going to get an iPhone regardless of all of those other factors. I enjoyed the video, I just felt like it was important to point out that in the year of our Lord 2023, people are clicking on this video to see if there can find another expert to agree with them in the neverending cell phone platform culture war than to actually figure out which one they want. I think it would be interesting to talk about who switches and why they switch though. There's probably some good insights there"

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"But the apple camera, you can't open it as fast as on an android. Ease of use, nah, it's also cause Apple doesn't let you do it your way, so, it seems easier because Apple doesn't allow you to try anything else. You get used to being told what to do. Not easier, just trapped."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I have to disagree on 4th, 5th, and 7th categories.  
        4th, updates. When it comes to the updates for the actual OS, Apple might have the advantage, but when it comes to app updates, because all app updates have to go through QC, they can sometimes lag behind Google.  Sometimes that lag can be long, even for critical vulnerabilities which should be patched asap.  That point kind of bleeds over to the 5th category. 

 As for the 7th category, Ecosystem, you didn't even include all of Googles ecosystem. You focused on Samsung for reasons I am unsure of, unless it was only to give Apple the advantage.  No mention of Nest Doorbells, Security Camera, Wi-Fi Router, Smoke & CO Alarm, Door lock, Thermostat.  These devices all work natively with any android via either Android Home or Nest apps and Apple has nothing they make that would compete with these.  If you're going to include ecosystem, then include all of the ecosystem, not what just one of the manufactures (Samsung) has.  Why is there no mention of Google? You know, the company who makes their phone without any bloatware (to counter your point of ""never any bloatware loaded onto the iPhone, ever"").

Last point, this isn't even a good comparison video.  you're comparing a phone (the iPhone) to an OS (Android).  There is only one iPhone, but multiple Android forks.  Either compare iOS to Stock Android (from Google, not another companies fork) or compare Apple to Google."

The “technology” reviewers(?) keep writing crap as they have a myopic view of the world.

Customisation gets a 5 point weightage! I don’t care about changing the icon every 2 weeks. I use my phone for some serious stuff. 

As I am typing this, I have a flight to catch and I know that I can leave my laptop behind as my files are synched to my phone & tablet for the meeting. 

I just returned a Samsung Flip 5. Exciting, but didn’t fit my use cases for the cover display."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"To be honest, to the basic user, there isn't much of a difference between the two."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Iphone need to bring back the fingerprint unlock. Face unlock is a pain in ass sometimes. Iphone low-light camera will always be inferior.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,You forgot the security topic
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"features that i absolutely love on android and really miss on apple are: 
1. mobile data detail view & consumption
2. swipe to call/message from phonebook
3. file manager
4. quick charging
5. higher refresh rate for cheaper models"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive been on both sides. honestly just get both lolol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I've got to say, before ease of use came up, I was having flashbacks to April fools with the Samsung Galaxy s23 ultra. And as someone who tried out an iPhone 13 pro on his way from the galaxy s8 to the galaxy s23, I disagree with the ease of use winner. It's only easy if you've never used anything else. If you try multitasking or downloading a file from your OneDrive to edit in excel and submit to your school's website (1 example of many), you're wasting your time if you're not on android.  

In the end, I still agree with the method. This is how everyone should learn to make difficult decisions."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dayum... 12 to 11 for Android for me. I guess that's why I simply can't decide ^^
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Don't give the apps category to apple when they're shady as hell with all that. Slowing phones down, so you'll upgrade, naaa that ain't cool"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Most of what is great about android doesn’t matter for serious users! 

I bought a Flip 5 and gave it up in 5 days to get back to IPhone 14PM. This is a cycle every 4-5 years and never feel Android to be well stitched + secure.

I am a senior technology professional who still codes!"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Being an android user forever I can't stand using iPhones. They just aren't intuitive for me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,2023 we still comparing 😢
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Great video....I simply love android because of customization and features.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I agree with you 100% i am all for android but i have and IPHONE because I married into to it. My wife have an android.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Well android overall is a better experience. I had iphone for many years until i switched to s23 ultra. The difference in what i experience is quite significant because iphone was a boring device. I can't understand why the  US is so passionate about imessage and facetime. In europe we barely use it. I never used it.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Booo, we all know its iPhone, just say it!"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Well done lol.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Focus mode is on my galaxy s20 and it is way advanced.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Face time and iMessage is shit everywhere else
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Apple as ecosystem winner :D
and Apps? I see way more apps reload on my iPhone than on my Android phone."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I'm 100 %Android user but I own Apple shares and I hope people keep buying Apple stuff. 😃
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,IOS 17— you still cant delete anything from the app while your in it! Deleting wallpaper you have to go to the lockscreen to delete it! you cant do it in the wallpaper’s app!! Absolutely a** backward—-💨
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Funny- I hate Apple and everything they are. Android speaks to me, thought I have my own issues with Google as well. Yet, I can stay away from iPhone, and it’s the platform, primarily iMessage, FaceTime, and airdrop. I know there are similar services (though FaceTime has proven to be the highest quality video chat platform for me), but those alternative services don’t have the people. They don’t have my people and therefore might as well not exist. I have a pixel I bought to supplement my iPhone, but it also overhears way too easy and is unusable where I live…"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Comments should have been turned off for this one 😆
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Apple does nothing for me outside of iMessage.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,About APP section... I don't think ease of update for developers is more relevant than the number of apps. (In the context of what is best for the actual user of the phone) This section should have been tie. Not to mention that Android supports .apk files which opens a whole new world of apps.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"buy both and stop sweating abouth things that doesn't matter. i couldn't care less about customization, i don't want my icons look like pokemons, i am not 12"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,YOU CANNOT title this video THE REAL WINNER and then be like its subjective >>>>:|||||
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Apple getting harder and harder to root for
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"If you say iOS you are talking about Apple also, so to compare with Android need to consider a supporting company too. Then we will basically comparing brands."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Only important comment

🎉There are more than 3 billion Android users and more 1 billion iOS users in the world.🎉

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Trouble on ecosystem is that you compared Apple to Samsung, not to Android. If you are on Android out of Samsung brand, you are out in the wild in this category."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The Lack of a Bitten Apple on the back of my phone, has made me an Android user 4L. ✝️"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I'd say Android still wins on the apps category due to APKs
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"The fact it’s almost literally iOS vs The World I gotta give it to Apple for holding that ground against the many, many almost endless amount of Android devices - well done Apple 👏"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"An excellent video, Marques! I love Android, my Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra 512Gb smartphone because I love customizing my Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra smartphone with cool themes, I know how to use my Android my smartphone. I don't like iPhone because they all are the same. You can't customize them as much as you can on Android Samsung Smartphones!!! Thank you. 😊"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,The real winner is the people who don’t debate on which phone is better
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"You must put weightage to each categories based on ""importance"""
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I’m so tired of this Apple vs android argument.  As long as the phone works who gives a damn what it is.  Everything is so good these days i feel like you really gotta be nitpicking to find issues with any flagship device.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,I'm not a fanboy. I use both but I personally prefer android.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,You forgot dex is a huge advantage for the Samsung ecosystem
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,So the take away is iphone won.. what else is new
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Great video but in my opinion repaiability is much more important than excitement
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Hi mkbhd....
I really think you should pay a visit to Nigeria. WE HAVE AN EXCITING YOUNG AND EXCITING TECH COMMUNITY OVER HER.

I CAN BET YOU THAT THE USE  AND POPULARITY OF  FACE TIME AND IMESSAGE ON IFPHONES OVER HERE WILL VERY WELL COMPETE WITH THE US.

ON AN AVERAGE,A YOUTH THAT USES AN ANDROID IN NIGERIA ALSO HAS AN IPHONE NEARBY AS THE MAIN ."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,You work for both but you like android the most but Apple pays you more money.
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"Today, my brother sent me a picture from his iPhone 14 to my Google Pixel 6 so I could quickly use magic eraser to remove an object. I think that says a lot!"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"You forgot to mention that you frequently need the newest gen Apple devices across the board to access any ecosystem synergy features. Have a slightly older iPhone? None of the new features will work. Slightly older mac? They stop even security updates after 5 years on some models now. Even Facetime stopped working across generations a while back, so I switched to Whatsapp."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Price also is L FOR IPHONE TOO
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Android all day
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,pfffffffft (android user)
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,Axeept it The dynamic island is a gimmicy way to hide the notch. Its just a notification center
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"I don't really know we can say ease of use is a good one, because even though I watch your videos and videos on iPhone when someone gives me there's I can't use it, I've grown up with samsung same can happen vise versa 😊"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"developers favor the iPhone because its users on average spend more money. thats why they prioritize iOS, not because its easier. developing on iOS is worse."
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"If Google could have aced it with ChromeOS and made it more towards developers/engineers, then the whole ecosystem and even the market in the US could have shifted!"
