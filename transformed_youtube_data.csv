nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how about one that folds out to a tablet   my z fold  does that   and dex allows screen mirroring to a windows desktop or notebook   also has stylus support with an s pen  fold edition or pro   the pro has many more features than the apple pencil  thanks to bluetooth and location ability   also controls the camera remotely and media

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot one category   the ethics and environmental record of the companies  i understand that most tech reviewers care not about anything but specs and features  but there is a real human cost to consider when purchasing products   this is why in my many years as a tech purchaser for govt there are some big brands that get left behind after the first round 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why does it using the google fold for the android phone   both have their pro’s and cons   ios has too many lockdowns but easy to use  icloud has many built in features that work in conjunction with the iphone and ipad and easy to use   i’m looking at one of the fold phones  because i could leave my ipad at home  problem is i’ve invested into too much apple eco system  ugh
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont why but value for money pricing wasnt a category considered here  considering the fact that it would be an important factor for a lot of people and we all know which side would have won that 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the ans is everyone wanna just show off
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i switched to android last may  ive owned iphones almost my whole life  my first was a samsung solstice  but after that it was the iphone s  i started to get really irritated with apple because they kept taking away features and asking for more money  im still pissed they took away the aux port  and in the last like  years they are adding almost nothing to the phone each year and asking for more money  android had everything i wanted the switch i just avoided because i didnt want to start over  but android plays nice with apple  apple does not play nice with android  you can get apple apps on android  including things like apple music 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, the winners are the multibillion dollar tech companies selling you shitty overpriced phones while harvesting all your data and selling it to advertisers 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,love that you have to ignore massive advantages in  categories  make a direct opposition category of customization  and ignore the quality of updates in the update section  how are you going to ignore the most important aspects of apps and ecosystems  freedom  all in favor of ease of use  why does the ease of use category exist when your argument for   categories is centered around ease of use  you say apple has a better ecosystem while ignoring the most important aspect  availability  if you yourself say that they are equal in seperate devices  then souldnt the winner be determined by how many devices are compatible with each ecosystem  if you talk about updates  then shouldnt you take about the quality of updates  it doesnt matter how long they get updated for  all that matters is how active and impactful those updated are also  why does the ease of use category exist  it is literally just an anti customization category   i came into this expecting a rational objective breakdown  and instead i saw blatant ignorance of information and contradictory categories and statements 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive been using motorola edge  for the last  years and have had zero problems  i just hate how big it is  now im looking at the iphone   but it seems like a downgrade in battery life  any suggestions 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i had an ipod and ipad because that’s what was the best back in   got my first good android  s  and found out about custom roms and basically got rid of my apple products right after  after about  years finally got an iphone and yes there’s some things i like but overall i hate it so much  it’s super buggy  the cameras don’t perform on my iphone  pro max as well as my budget phone s fe which wasn’t close to top of the line and is older  i’m constantly annoyed with my iphone  i can’t wait to upgrade my android phone and could care less about upgrading the iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,are there numbers on the percentage of users who dont use   of features on a phone   entire swathes of the population only text call snapchat youtube and all of those features were available on the first generation of smart phones
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i laughed from start to end watching a clear apple lover  trying so much to pretend to be impartial but always chosing apple  no   giving an edge  to android when android is miles ahead is stupid  hype on iphone   was a copy paste of   lol  dont want to be impartial and do your research  dont make a video that burns you 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,remember they are competing to get your money 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think there are important things that were left out to mention  for example the price  on iphone you have to pay much more to get the same hardware features since you are paying for the brand
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i feel android is easy to use than iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bruvs android better for gaming 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lol yeah  ill spend   to be a part of apples ecosystem  or suffer because you cant enjoy an apple product without the full package 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i like to use a phone for many years  it cost a lot of money  so it has to work long and with updates  thats why i like apple

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,most of my friends that have android phones have no idea how to do anything or find anything on the phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so  what youre saying is that ios is made for stupid people  got it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,whatever  android is better 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,from what i feel and how i draw a parallel between these two brands  it’s like bentley and lexus  i like both the cars but on a bentley doesn’t expect all those features of lexus  different vibes altogether and different class  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thanks for the video marquez  i didn’t realize you’d actually do it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i don’t think i’ll be buying another iphone  the charging ports are terrible and the chargers are shit  not to mention if a cat sneezes on them you’ve got a shattered screen  way overpriced and overrated 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the best in everything is always subjective  they are both good in their own way  my take on this is that android is for people who like personalizing things on their phones  iphones are for people who want refined and simple phone  the year  is the peak of mobile phones 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,not entirely sure about your system  i own androids since ever  i am then drawn into customization features and excitements  android brought that to us  so according to your system i will always be android  but when i now see the seamless integration of devices within the apple ecosystem  say air drop iphone to macbook way back when  im tempted to switch to get these features  would be an expensive switch though  anyway  great video as usual
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me iphone winner  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for apps android is better you can sideload it i could download apps for free in google where in play store i had to pay it  the only thing i love about iphones is that it says longer for its smoothness like it doesnt get laggy easily unlike androids this could be false since im talking about this from my experience when i was young i had a samsung tablet and it got laggy easily and then i got an apple ipad it stayed longer but still got laggy i dont know if this is still true   and there is another thing that i remember about my old apple ipad which was ios  and i could update it up to ios   and then i didnt get any updates and then later to download youtube you need to have ios  and above which i couldnt download it and i had to use safari to watch youtube which was pain
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hey dude  where on the iphone is the  back  button  and how many steps do you make to find the current date  you are an apple user fan  and i dont want to spend two months income on a piece of tech from apple  but  your opinion and mine are different 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"tried switching from asus zenfone  to iphone  pro my deal breaker from iphone is     doesnt even have access file manager  my work requires a lot of back to back file access   no finger print  i tried to open my iphone in the dark and it cant read my face  even tho my pin is only  number short  its really anoying  i mean  cmon  my brother have   realme phone and finger print sensor works fast as hell    battery life  tried switching from  time charge a day phone to   times charge a day it feels like a freakin joke  i almost never bring my charger to my office with zenfone and with iphone i have to bring it everywhere   at this point i finally understand why iphone user always carry small bag everywhere they goes  to store their charger and power bank    slow charging  imagine switching from asus hypercharge speed   in  minutes which can fit for my entire day activity to   in  minutes  it almost drives me crazy"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  yah  tell that to huawei   and others   they compete until an outsider is about to win  why do you think samsung dont push too much  also ecosystem is only in us  the rest of the world is out there and is out of that to so uno revers  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps one is clearly a android w 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,man i had apple everything for a long time  but i been a droid boy for about ten years now   and you know what really strikes me   granny smith was always my favorite apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,just have both and be happy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my moto android cost me £ brand new  and it does everything i want it to do  yes  sure you can compare high end phones   but what can apple offer for that price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how is price not a category in this 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,first off  you didnt even mention sideloading apps  that feature alone pushes the apps category over to android  dont like the youtube app  theres countless variations  including some that unlock most of the premium features  for free on the internet to download the  apk file and install  completely bypassing the google play store and the samsung galaxy store  then theres the emulators that are still on the google play store  apple never lets emulators on their store for very long  if they can slip past their approval process  you cant tell me apple wins apps when they restrict what you can do with the hardware you bought so tightly   also  samsungs ecosystem has the unique functionality of crossing over to play nicely with googles ecosystem and microsofts ecosystem  the combination of those three ecosystems that all work together  as well as the variety an choice they provide  beats apples hands down  dont forget about all of googles smart home devices and features  if a smart home device cant pair with google home  its dead in the water   as for updates support  sure  apple has great customer service  but theyd rather sell you a new phone than fix your existing one  if we consider repairability  apple has a long way to go  these vary widely on android depending which company you look at  on one hand  the fair phone is a prime example of repairability being the first priority  and on the other  samsung and google support their old phones for way longer than ive ever had the same phone for  so in the end  theres nothing special about receiving updates for a long time  a lot of companies do that  this category shouldve at least been a tie  if not an android win because of the repairability of some brands   those  corrections make the winner android   to   the only thing apple has going for it is ease of use  but even that is iffy  to me  who has only owned windows and android devices  apple devices are way harder for me to use  i would need a long time to acclimate to all the strange little differences in daily tasks  for someone whos never seen a smart phone before  yes  apple is more beginner friendly  but for anyone with an ounce of tech savvy  theyre both super easy to use  apple just also has a low ceiling  meaning once youve got the basics  theres nothing deeper to dive into for more unique use cases    in the end  this video just reminded me why i will never buy an iphone  i was getting tempted by the   but the only good thing about iphones is the dumbed down user experience  which is a bad thing  to me  in the end  pitting one company with their own standard against an army of companies building on a shared standard is just no contest  if you limit android to just samsung or just google  maybe youd have a close fight  but if youre talking about all of android  theres just too much variety to compare to one company  even if that company is as big as apple  thanks for coming to my ted talk 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i disagree that iphone doesnt have bloatware i mean all the apps like apple health  apple podcast or the news app all few examples of apps that many people might not even install but they are still pre installed yes we can uninstall them but same can be done on android the apps are made by apple doesnt mean they are bloatware i mean samsung is many times criticized by reviewers for putting their own apps in the phone pre installed that are not useful for everyone then why are apple apps that are not useful to all not considered bloatware
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the ecosystem factor is not as strong outside the us however  the main reason i wont switch is that im too lazy   its better to invest your time in other activities rather than learning new os tricks 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the navigation of apple apps are different on a per app basis  meaning for example that you have to swipe down on the iphone youtube app to close the video  on other apps you then again swipe left or right to close something or go back again  this is simply very inefficient  makes my workflow very slow in comparison to android devices  where going back is very consistent across apps   the only real comparison basis you have isd
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,serious question  as a android user   what is imessage facetime  are these like apple version of text messaging and video call  and why do some people cant live without it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you clearly didnt mention price because iphone would loose  funny
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone gets more chicks and that’s better than the features on android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,always android  and samsung is the best  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the usb c iphone is now here  it would be great to recount these thoughts again in   and then decide on a new winner 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is a mental stigma
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wow  i havent seen a video like this so neutral and interesting  very good 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the real difference is price  iphone is a trophy phone with a price justified by the logo  android is just a different software system that is applicable for multiple phone manufacturers  multiple phonemanufacturers allow a wider spectrum of options  i see waaayyy to many people buy the iphone and act like it didnt blast a hole through their wallet  specially young and broke uni students    i also think we have reached a stage were phones are nitpicking in quality difference  the nitpicking feels over the top and to quote a wise man   if i can watch movies and porn on it  its nasa shit 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wow   excelent review
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,developers who like to build themselves personalized apps  need a macbook in order to develop iphone apps  for android  you can make apps on windows 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,any particular reason for ignoring possibly the most important category    business use  the business world is today either on ms or google and neither prioritizes apple ecosystem  which is also incredibly limiting in itself  from apps e g  office to services such as mdm  ios is light years behind android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  they are updated at the same time just on the play store it gets a human review before being published and ios it doesnt  that means it gets released on ios first 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me  its not just android  its the pixel specifically  they may not be  the best phones  out there  but you can change the operating system and block all the spywear and bolster privacy   right now  pixels are the best phones    honestly  im amazed google hasnt shut this down  yet 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,repairability 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what’s the point of an app store anymore when the most basic app is a yearly monthly weekly subscription 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this dude will be a cyborg by 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thanks 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you guys should i get a galaxy a or iphone se
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i will say that every so often an update on my android will move the keyboard buttons just slightly  not enough to notice visually  but enough where my thumbs will hit the wrong keys 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  bro predicted the iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,focus mode is available on google pixel a since launched 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,guess which phone normies prefer 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,personally i disagree with the apps category because of the one simple fact that not only are there more apps but you can litteraly download anything and the ecosystem category because of the fact that the ecosystem of one company that is apple is the best singular ecosystem compared to the ecosystems of every smartphone brand is way better when you have something that can connect with anything
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,terrible video as usual 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one customization that i need is root access  all the rest is minor 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,please add subtitles in russian please 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,best explanation of this issue
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,like this comment markus
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,best presentation
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,seriously  ease of use to the iphone  theres no back button  no t dialing and no numbers   symbols on the keyboard 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im by no means a techie  but i just cant see myself limiting my options to just apple products  its   why would anyone just buy from a single brand  i bought a flip  a few years ago  dropped it too much because im careless  but who doesnt drop their phone  now i bought a red magic  pro  its fun just trying different things out 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think android is probably better than apple  but it is missing one big thing  game pigeon  so i would have to buy apple despite android being clearly better for me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is for people who like tech  apple is for people who are not interested in tech  easy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy   here legends in india provide whole family a phone with charger and case in box  xiaomis poco f as a reference  m antutu    have better fast charging  freedom at the price of  iphone  pro max    bro didnt even mentioned third party app installation  and the fact that all android is way superior then an iphone  bro i dont believe you are a tech youtuber  as you primarily focused on what you get out of the box  even then android wins  bruh you are crazy  yeah average us people 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,very politically correct video lol  ddd you dont wanna anger apple fanboys and samsung knights  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,   ease of use can be ticked for android too if properly configured   updates and support  samsung s phones get  years of support which is more than enough for   of the users  so a tick for android as well  not universally tho    apps  please  android    ecosystem  how is apple vendorlocking a plus  tick for android   basically  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i was thinking of switching from android to ios  but as ive never owned an apple device i didnt know what to expect  thanks for the comparison  i dont think apple is for me haha 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,mr marques  talk about details please  the details are the ones that make the difrence  i ve had android phones all the time and now that i chenged to iphone  the only thing i hate is the phone app  on android when you start typing a phone number it starts showing phone numbers on the list that contain the numbers you have dialed  as the keyboard  sucks  in greek language  i want to turn back to my precius android category to get good battery  free apps  better customization  better apps  the only good thing about iphone is that it is fast and is smaller than the androids nowadays 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you should also add the accessibility ans affordability aspect which is more important for developing countries 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the digital payment revolution   the digital id  digital public infrastructure in india  couldnt have been possible without affordable mobile plans and android devices  so android for me  indian digital payments powered by upi  on mobile surpassed all major card network payments  good tech should be for the masses  affordable and easy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have been an apple user for decades so switching to android is never going to happen  i am impressed by his balanced approach to both platforms so i can clearly see both sides of the debate  since i own an imac  a macbook  an iphone  an ipad and an apple watch  i am totally happy being a locked in resident of apple’s ecosystem  i am a retired senior citizen who has lived in the same house for  years  i have also been married to the same person for  years so i admit to being firmly set and comfortable in my ways 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,something alot of people forget is that imessage and facetime is used  almost  exclusively in the us  the rest fo the world uses whatsapp  facebook messanger  telegram  etc 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i had to pause this video to respond to your statement  apple controls customer service for better or worse    i literally burst out laughing   you are right  apple controls their customer service because they actually have customer service   how much is it worth to have actual stores  a   phone number you can ask for help with your apple product   this ultimately why  android sucks ass 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i am someone who unsubscribed to you sinc years back  microsoft and google worked together for years now since samsung galaxy s   they combine great stuff  plus samsung has dex  u didnt mention that  cameras  u didnt mention that  etc etc
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think that type c is overrated  and im a long time android user  i find apple charging port tend to not get as much debris inside as any type c port  and is much easier to clean if debris does get in
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me it is  android  thank you marques 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you didnt talk about security comparission bro
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,switched to android in  when apple came out with iphone x over   the galaxy  was like   bucks with tb more space and way more features  i love google workspaces  docs  drive  gmail  phone  google music app was is way better streaming platform  never looked back and always had a better overall phone for less money and more control  love android and yes i have a macbook pro  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, competing against each other to get better   still have shit texting with iphones and any other phone  maybe one day they will actually get better but texting is such a basic feature that still isnt being done right  its   wtf
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,watch the video if u want but apple won bc hes in the us and popularityother than that android shoudlve won
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the biggest reason and advantage for me is the apple ecosystem  how the devices flawlessly interact with each other  i probably will never know the joy of being able to customise your wallpaper and all the other things that android offers  im convinced android is equally an amazing os   i just cant see myself missing out of the flexibility of ios and how it integrates with every app and device that i use   im sure android users equally have solid reasons for sticking with android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,but most android apps are free compared to iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i decided to try an s once   android it’s clearly such a badly optimised and written operating system    error codes to do with apk or something reminded me of of the windows blue screen of death    audio randomly not working sorry but the share sheet that suggests people and apps on ios was like either awful or non existent   for a system that is designed to have multiple interfaces yet wasn’t designed in a compartmented way such as system then interface on top  so had to wait for security updates  just shows how badly thought out android is    not to mention its bloated system preferences  it felt like i was on a sort of nuts and bolts operating system not a professional consumer product with finish and everything working like text font sizes clashing with dialog boxes and translation that didn’t work properly i mean you wouldn’t get away with it with any other consumer product except an os like android   never again
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you were to do apple vs samsung with this exact same list  would you still give it to apple  i think  ease of use  would still be apple but the rest would become ties most of the time  right 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i hate iphones  they embody everything wrong with corporate greed  you spent a fortune on it  but it wants all your money and data  forces you to put your bank details in it and its a thief magnet  you need to use the health app to set the alarm  why  i use the alarm as a reminder  not just for waking up good hardware  extremely annoying software  also i like customization  i dont like android neither but i can adapt it to my needs  it doesnt have the level of security   control im used to  control over cookies ect  so android gets  points and iphone gets   i just wish the pine phone worked 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i used to be a apple guy  but then android took off and i was tired of my iphone screen breaking and all the locked options and settings iphone doesnt even have or has locked it behind their ios  i felt like i was getting robbed by apple  and was paying for the logo  switched to android and never looked back ever since  loving my new google pixel and the photo recalibration is outta this world
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,give me one good reason to switch to iphones  been using android since   im serious finding hard
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i literally cannot decide between the two  i keep switching back and forth  maybe the solution is to have both haha 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,loved the question you asked siri
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i do not agree with the easy of use  i littery choose simpler android phones for my parents to use because iphone is too complicated for them 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wdym  i have a realme since   and it has alwasy have focus mode   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you love iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  you can just use routines for this
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is a bit boring but execution is very good  android has a lot more variety and customization so a lot more choice  both are now too expensive on the high end  and android has a lot more choice in the low and mid ranges 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,late to this video but leaving out durability and picture quality is kind of weird  those are  of the major things people here in the u s  talk about between them 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  what dock is that
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lmao wow lock screen customization and basic ass  widgets  ios really has caught up to android customization
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung now supports  years and  generations on the s series
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,focus mode had been available on android long before you made this video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,here in the philippines most of iphones are second hands 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone cannot even download in the background no mp ringtone  cannot even move apps anywhere
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive been on the samsung galaxy s+ for the better part of  years  i still receive system updates every month or so  updated android apps have continued working well  im able to take my phone to a repair shop and replace a charging port  or a headphone port  or the battery  and theyll almost all have parts already on hand and will have be back up and running in under an hour  i daily drove an iphone  back in the day  ultimately  the ecosystem annoyed me endlessly and ease of use for my use was not good  im still happy with the options available for the android platform when making my choice of next phone  that said  apple has made it harder to ignore their updated devices  even if only because  as a developer  i cant deploy to the platform without a device  the walled garden may bother me more than anything for that reason 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nice biased video   on categories you came up yourself 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple boy at it again    
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it really still depends on the user  me for example  i like gaming a lot and i hate it when my hands gets fried from gaming on an iphone for even just like mins  i thought they fixed that on the iphone  to  pro max but some people say it still gets super hot  and when it gets hot the screen will automatically dims  also i’m from philippines and we are not familiar with imessage and facetime  we mainly use facebook’s messenger where you can message and videocall anyone who uses messenger 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung has way more devices and works fine even fridges can connect to your computer but ios is smooth so it wins that category yhh okay buddy
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,missing one category  security privacy
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,to all of you arguing which phone is better  get a job 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the biggest disadvanteges of iphones these days    lack of splitted screen    lack of messenger bubbles   they are for left handed  back gesture is useble only in left hand or whern you keep it in both hands 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so your daily phone is an android  why the apple watch  how do you manage  phones  who do you give which number 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i disagree with the ease of use thing cuz for example android has a back button which is a lot easier to use  or clipboard which lets u use ur notes seamlessly  these are some of the examples
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is better you can track your phone if it’s lost and it’s smoother plus it get more updates
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the only thing with focus modes are that samsung actually has work modes and sleep modes that resemble the focus modes
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bought it phone  pro st time ios  experience…  its feel like i have downgraded my tech experience…  don’t understand why apple hype is so much…
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so in the end i came to the conclusion that  i have budget for neither one
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,yes and it makes it sometimes quite hard to choose the next phone  i abandoned android due to updates  ecosystem  as i dont care much about any specific feature if then it lacks hard on something else 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,porque me sale su video en español exijo el ingles
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have been an androdist but every phone upgrade comes different and un intuitive  i dont recommend it for non techy people
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i hate how iphone basically restricts you on everything 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its   if you havent picked a side already  where ya been 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,privacy is an important one that was left out  but great video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,can’t have a tech video without saying  flag ship  at least once 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have the iphone  pro max and want to change  i own almost all apple products in my house but ever since they started pushing these woke bullshit politics i want to stop using them 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android has focus modes  or samsung has it atleadt
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the analytic hierarchy process  ahp  is a multi criteria decision making method that can be effectively used to evaluate and compare different options based on multiple factors  use ahp to assess the relative merits of android and ios smartphones  considering their key features  user preferences  and overall value proposition 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,people talk about comparessing but in the end of the day   of all people will take iphone over the android specially with price of andorid these days 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,google pixel are much better than i phone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use   come on you just gave a point to the iphone out of charity 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no shot  i made the same rating a him  haha nice to see that i have the same  opinions as my favorite tech youtuber 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when i see an iphone it reminds me of a childrens book  and very cartoony 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,do you want to come to japan sometime  i can show you around  japanese is crazy about apple product  i think they can rival usas popularity 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot all the sideloaded apps that are not in the the google playstore which google allows you to do and apple by eu court order just now started to allow 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me best of both  a phone somewhere in the middle ive owned both i like both for diff reasons 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,under updates doesnt apple force you to update your phone eventually even if you dont want it and also havent they been exposed for sending the slow down or kill the phone updates manipulating you into buying the latest models that are + dollars i dont think that can be a win  and ease of use i dont see the iphone as the winner either you have to use gestures or swiping android lets you choose that or have a simple  or  or  button menu at the bottom ease of use doesnt mean oh ive used iphones my whole life so i know everything cause they never change anything or innovate   ease of use is when ive never seen this phone in my life i can pick it up and instinctively know how to navigate use it with ease   what do i know tho¯⁠\⁠_⁠ ⁠ツ⁠ ⁠_⁠ ⁠¯
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android users can s m d
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,andriod is better than apple any day i can prove that quick 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,every android i got crapped out and was buggy within a year  didnt matter which company made the phone including google  not impressed 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone has the fastest cpu and snapdragon  gen  is still  generations behind  they tried keeping up with multi core scores now because they are too far off to compete with apple at this point  better software on iphone and combined with better hardware  picking iphone is a nobrainer especially if u play games and multi task  iphone destroys samsung here  if ure into taking pictures and are good at editing them and or customizing of photos  samsung destroys the iphone here except video    here are the facts  stop crying about it because ure wrong and pick your phone now 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the ease of use categorie has to go to android  just because of itunes  i had a iphone for over a year now after always using android phones  i could never load all my music to the iphone  so i gave up  first  you have to tag all your k songs individually  and than  when i copied everything on the iphone  so many songs where still missing  why  because apple does not know this songs and they are not available on apple music  also music got deleated apple did not like  wtf  who do they think they are to delete my things because they dont want me to have ot  so stupid   and no ldac codec aswell  hello xperia v  and in terms of apps  i still had to charge my android phone every day when i used the iphone over a year  because there are many apps i dont got in the appstore  mostly my language learning stuff was not available  dealbreaker nr     btw   arques  you rated the camera of the xperia wrong  because you are not a photographer and it seems that you dont know how to use it right    in the right hands  it destroys other phones cameras for sure 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use goes to ihone how you tried connecting iphone with pc or even tried to share anything with iphone even with another iphone aps goes to iphone android can install anything there is only  that iphone has an edge over android n thats security and maybe cameras
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use would not go to apple when all they do is make products with design flaws and literal anti repair measures so you have to spend more money on a new phone or laptop  that is not easy that is a headhache
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you like customization  youre an android user   but  if you like ease of use  youre an apple user 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dude   just choose a winner in your opinion   from what i have gathered  the android is your winner 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i kinda feel like he is an apple fan boy
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ill have to disagree with the ease of use and your basis of that  except for this all is good with your presentation   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well  you are obviously an ios user and did not really understand android well enough  is it easy of use when every app has another way to go a step back  like on ios  and you can not even mount it as a volume and use it on the desktop  android is way more consistent  there are always the same basic buttons on the bottom present  and you can easily drag and drop any file into the mounted volume  so that point is clearly also gonna go to android  the ecosystem of android is open and includes many brands  with their gadgets and services  that of apple is a limited closed system to their own products and not very adaptable  so this point also goes clearly to android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,and then divide this   vs   score with price    ios vs   android  so it will be actually  vs   wtf where is the price category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you’re payed by apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the score is   android has a much bigger variety of apps and functionalities through them  and the ecosystem you can literally command google assistant through your smartwatch to flush the toilet
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,come on man  android is king of diversity  connectivity  versatility  innovation your iphone viewers just have to suck it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,not enthusiast  theyre brain washed evangelists and me too herd
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lack of a back button belongs to ease of use in ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple does not allow sideloading of apps either which to me offsets the advantage of having more optimized apps 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my phone almost as fast and save over 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this guy should be on tv  his explanations are very good 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  yeah not anymore lol  both pixel and samsung now have more os support than iphones   also ease of use is basically the same for both phones  thats not an issue in  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive used the note + for over  years now  i run a launcher  have custom icons  and i use custom widgets  i cant go to an iphone customization is a make or break in and of itself 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,subjective winner aka biased winner
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,not to be cheesy  cmon bro…lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,customization  ui and ux   on android is on top of the apple  you can literally change anything on android phone   this is a `must have` for me   about the cost of phone  iphones are one category  definitely  not cheap  while on android  you can have a phone for any budget  imo
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,oh yeah  lets just give the apps category to ios despite the fact that it doesnt even have side loading  so you can only pick from the very limited selection on the app store 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro didnt mention apple scamming all the mobile game companies
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,none of this was surprising to me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps definitely go to the android hands down 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is  and has been ahead of iphone for ages 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im sure apple is the most strongest company in the world
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great presentation  as always
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,switched to iphone pro max  months ago and really miss the android advantages in customisation  notifications  back button etc  will use it for another year and then move back to android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so amazing to see someone beeing so natural and not toxic  you are so right  buying a phone is a very personal experience  d
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is dead 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have to argue against your decision on the app criteria   forget updates  there are apps and features that you can find in one system and not the other  the difference  if you cant find something on the android  give it some time and youll get it  if you cant find it on ios  good luck  the reason is simple  the ios store is extremely pricey for a small time dev  basically  if you dont plan to add commercials or have people pay for the app  its not happening on ios   i have a friend who really likes this board game  a very popular on named dice throne  and the game had a campaign mode that was really missing an up to log or update your set of cards for the next meeting  so he built an app  uploaded it to the play store  and paid the tiny fee  when people started asking about an ios version  he told them he would give the source code to anyone willing to pay to put it on the ios store  its been a couple of years and he couldnt find anyone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as of now  google pixel announced that the new pixel  will receive  years   i think android should win for the support  coming from an iphone user 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone for sure
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple  pay about   to unlock developer option  antroid  click this  times and you will have developer option i will always choose android  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsungs got focus mode  dont they
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont care  i used both  i will buy whatever i think is best for me  i dont care about the os
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont understand why a catagory for media  spefically music  isnt included in the shoot out every year between apple and samsung  as good as spotify is  when it comes to clarity and overall sound quality  apple smokes anything in the android market  im a truck driver  i carry an s ultra for the simple reason that android works better with the things i require of my device  and if im honest i feel my samsung is a better balanced device  it doesnt shine as brightly as an apple device in some areas  but it does more things with better consistency than apple  and the reliability factor with samsung  ie that the device is going to do what you need it to do when you need it is better with samsung but when i get ready to seriously listen to tunes  ny earbuds are plugged into my ipad 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about price range  you can buy an android for as cheap as  usd and would do the job  bang for buck should be a category for sure
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android all day never had a iphone never will
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,do you like to tinker  or get something that’s just works out of the box   my brother bought my mother an android phone and my mother’s phone conversations ends with how can she get some android function to work  inevitably i reply i’ve got an iphone  i can’t help you with this  you need to talk to my brother  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i was an exclusively android user who just switched to iphone because the it has the best wearable  the apple watch is the most accurate for heart rate and sleep tracking and that was enough to convince me to change  so far no regrets
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,pacifists huh 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i usually buy samsung tvs and iphones because i like things that don’t work well together 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the ecosystem answer was stupid  android has many more things than iphone  iphone is the same old thing 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone way better
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about the fact that almost every single feature on apple devices can be replicated on android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how about ease and cost of battery replacement  and repairability of same 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  of phone users do not care about   of the options  details  spec that you’re talking about   camera notch  usb c or thunderbolt  customization  background colors  number of apps…no one cares   most people buy a phone to text  read the news  social media and maybe listen to music   i switched from apple to android for  weeks and the reason i didn’t like it   not the camera notch  usb c thunderbolt  customization  background colors or number of apps   i wanted a decent built in music app and android didn’t have a decent one and no  i don’t want youtube music 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps going to apple genuenly makes no sense tf 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use should go to android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,still no whatsapp for ipad 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,google pixel will be having  years of updates right  if i remember correctly 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hi  i didnt want to comment but i have to  until sept  i have used android phones   samsung  xiaomi and oneplust t best phone ever  for me ios its almost the same as android  personal thought  as per ease of use for me an iphone  ios  doesnt seem to be easier to use as an android phone  its the same from my point of view  as ecosystem  yes iphone macbook ipad yes its better but you should take in consideration also the cost  how much cost is for an iphone + macbook + ipad  and how much an android phone  + a windows laptop and tablet nowadays everything is vs cost 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,price is another point  i live in italy and for us iphone is really expensive   all phones  good ones for sure  are expensive but is easier get android phones   i am an android fan  also like a lot apple   i love my ipad   for some reasons and the price is one of them  for me   my wife and my friends too 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if the conclusion to this question isnt  capitalists  capitalists are the winners  then this is a bad video title 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android vs ios = freedom vs control = open vs closed environment = anarchy vs order
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you just have to pick one thats best for you  whats best for a  year old gamer might not be best for a  year old retiree 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is better and ive had both but i stick with the galaxies which are android so ya samsung galaxy ultra>>>>>>iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,who all supports apple edit  thanks for  like
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you consider foldable as feature  then android gets another hell yeah 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android just has pretty more useful features than iphone  i cant really get used to iphone  back key  clipboard on the keyboard  screen customization etc are only on android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,americans  imagine iphone with android system will it still be the fastest  android system is so heavy than ios  as you know  android has a lot of countless features and ios what does it have  or  features how could it not be the fastest in the world wait  i forgot something  apps and games they make software to run it smoothly not the performance of the hardware but the performance of the software all that is in the iphone is the high price that makes those who own it rich to impress his friends
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i actually prefer apple because it is limited on customization   android tends to have too much going on on their home screen for me  apple is very clean   also  i find apple is easier for my senior citizen mom to use as well   i get a lot less calls for tech support when she has an apple vs when she had an android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android has to win apps  this is totally bias  i am an android user  i decided to try iphone and the apps really gave me a tough time  decided to switch back to android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as someone who have used both  for me personally  i choose android  the freedom  the ease in sharing things across different devices  the usability  i use old devices  as apples old devices are almost unusable due to the old ios version bot being able to download many apps  using an old android tablet the same age as the ipad still enables me to install most apps  or at least using an older version of the apk  also  we have old android tablets that are equipped with the amoled screen  not the old ipads  and im in love with amoled despite my having to take a good care of it in order not to cause burn in  so android for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,issues in ios i have seen in multiple devices     no end button for an upcoming call while you are talking to someone   either put on hold or cut the current call  whf apple     bro apps also crashes here and behaves unexpectedly  phone heats up a lot sometimes     ios runs only single thread at a time    i have tested it successfully in some scenarios      i hate to search for contact every time i have to call someone  such a pain     typing on ios default keyboard is frustrating 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use  android all day  i have iphone for work and private android  everytime i use iphone i find something more complicated than android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,surprise  the locked down  overpriced fashion accessory won
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,returned a pixal  unable to send voice messages thur the text  get message recording cancelled  problem well documented on the google community pages  at present google does not have a solution for  wanted the  year security updates and love the size of the phone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro google gives  years of updates
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple definetly wons the shockingly greedy and restrictive vampire swine contest 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my only problem  with apple is you cannot download modded apps  thats a massive deal breaker for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you are the best 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my most critical factor was size so i stick with my pixel a xd
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is the clear leader with a market share of   in q   ios has a market share of   showing promising growth  if you know you know
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is so biased imo  he basically stole some categories such as ecosystem and apps  there is no way ios comes anywhere close  since this is a comparison of firmwares 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im sorry but at this point i think ease of use should go to android  every reviewer knows ios front to back so for them it might seem easy to use  but there are so many things that are impossible to figure out without outside help  the quick pull down setting menu only has icons and some of them look like nothing you would know and there is no description  also some of them can be long tapped and then it can do more but there is no indication which one will react to the long tap which one wont  android has long tap for opening the settings for them  and an arrow on the side you can click to the special added funcions for the button  makes absolute sense even a first time user will see that there are buttons without the arrow and buttons with so yeah  with the iphone you are just trying and learning which is absolutely horrible ui design  this is just one example but there are lots of stuff like this  i think android right now is insanely intuitive  every person i had to show android phones for the first time picked them up easily  on the other hand there are iphone users who had been apple fans for years and years and their mind can be blown with some functions they never realized their phone had because the ui gives no indication of it at all
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,where the sony phones at 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,u gave the ecosystem to ios because u are in the us  but wait a minute android is also a us company or
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in terms of development  android development is agnostic of the hardware you are writing the code on  ive been able to write on linux  windows  and yes macos if i wanted to dive into satans ballsack  in terms of if i wanted to develop an app for ios  i better have an ios device to run xcode  and i cant use my ios phone   so it locks me into also buying a mac if i wanted to  i would call this the developer category   yes  ios apps are easier to update once created due to the devices  but creating an app on android is far more entry friendly as a developer   this was a category i weigh highly as well  but probably doesnt matter to most users since they arent developing apps as a hobby work 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,where the fuck is the price category
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,diplomatic  in this video  you know apple watches this   you have to give it to them  anybody watching this would surely now the results beforehand  you had to give it to apple as they look close to your opinion and will not value you for their events keynotes  if something lesser to complete  you not afraid of android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android no
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i hate apple and never going back  my unihertz tank  arrived today 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a very thoughtful review  which is really what your subscribers have come to expect  for those of us who don’t have any blind loyalty towards either system  it’s hard to disagree with anything you say 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love the launchers  on samsung galaxy ultra s  also the square look   looks so much cooler    but i also love  the iphone  especially now  with the iphone  with thinner bezels   if only they could get rid of that stupid notch 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont care what anyone says  the ease of use is butt cheeks on iphone imo  my wife wont switch off iphone because she doesnt know if she will lose her pictures im not kidding   i use galaxy and i can never seem to figure out how to do what she needs  the settings are ridiculous  its a list of like  damn settings with seemingly no rhyme or reason to placement  there is no designated back or home button  which makes no sense to not have   on samsung  when you upgrade your phone  the transfer is seemless  on iphone  i nor cricket could figure out how to transfer her pictures  i keep getting an error saying it failed to prepare the transfer  i looked it up and it is a known problem  i tried all of the fixes and none have worked so far    when i send videos to her through a message  for some reason her iphone compresses my videos to where it is like p  but if an iphone sends one to her  its fine   when i scroll through her pictures  i can never seem to grab the vertical slider  it works like   of the time and she cant do it either  thats on her old and new phone  so it cant be the screen   i could say more but id be here for a week  i cannot stand iphones  i recognize that there are some cool things like the autoecosystem but thats literally it for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i just got an iphone today  been an android user for a decade gonna try the apple finally
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i had a few iphones and the reason why i always go back to android is the freedom and accessibility i have over the phone  with ios you feel kind of limited of what you can do  or at least i do   ending up paying £ for an iphone and you cant even put your favorite tune for a ring tone  as you said in the video  everything has to be done the apple way   i dont like this motto 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont think that appel should get the app bc my old appel can maybe do   of them  also ecosystem you forgot the samsung smart fridge tbh lol 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, th comment
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would give the apps to android simply bcoz u can sideload apps
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i want to get an iphone but the one thing that really annoys me is not being able to move apps to certain areas of the grid
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,something about ios just works for me and i like how the os is simple yet elegant  not a big fan when it comes to tinkering  i just need it to work and be reliable  and i feel like apple does a better job when it comes to privacy for the user    one thing i don’t like are the ios fanboys  they reek of douchebag and act like iphone is the end all be all  for me i just think apple makes some good shit and is very reliable  despite the cringe fan base 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i tried i tried to like android but it just cant match the cohesiveness of i os  ipados and macos because yeah well google cant match that 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the thing to remember about apple  though  is its extreme anti consumer attitude  theyve been pulling dirty tricks for a very long time  and many people end up buying a new device for no better reason than apple demands it  screw apple the last apple device i was willing to buy was the ipod  original gb model  mine still works  but has been supplanted by a large sd card in my galaxy s +  which will soon be replaced with a larger one  the nasty little tricks they pull  like the five lobed screw heads  can be gotten around  but it isnt worth the struggle or expense to repair a lot of apple products  not to mention the fact that theyre overpriced for what you get 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,copy and paste has been on iphone for a while   nothing new
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how do you not cover privacy or security as categories   because youre not a coder or security sleuth  i get it     as a dev whos been under to hood on both platforms  it needs to be stated how horrible android has been for peoples privacy  and its made even worse by the additional privacy violations perpetrated by the majors like samsung    go dig into the stack  why is the  for example  samsung photo gallery constantly talking to samsung   is that ok with everyone     why does almost every major process within the android stack talk to the cloud     the amount and depth of the tracking and analytics being run on android users is insane     enough said 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im not sure who cares how fast a social media app is updated when the old one works perfectly fine  but the sheer number of apps and the ability to side load any app you like should have given the win to android imo 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im from android myself  but i understand why users from iphone may love android  that freedom to do so much customization with it but i fell in love ios because of its simplicity and cleaningness  i never needed to do the lot of customization
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,scheduled texts  dex  file management   my android is a workhorse   i only use a laptop when i need more space to work edit 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the day i want to get hijacked or robbed by a company ill get an apple device 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is the so called software giant  they made an application called  move to ios  to switch from android to apple  but it doesnt work  it turned my gallery into trash  he streamed the same video  times  so are the photos  some apps could not be transferred  supposedly  whatsapp can transfer one of the two applications  but he cant do that either  he doesnt say  something went wrong  and doesnt convey it  i tried many times but it doesnt work   software giant   yes  i wanted to use iphone but it wasnt possible  he couldnt even make a transfer app for himself  what a shame 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for features i would have liked to see you mention that while all the features are on the one iphone  pro models at least  but lots of features on android are spread across lots of phones and companies  so you can have any one of them  you might have to choose 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dont forget built in tasker
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,focus mode of iphone is routies in samsung like   years ago it was introdused
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont know where you live but in france young people just want apple phones and only apple   older ones dont really care but the youngs do  all there friends at school have iphones   so they want iphone too  its simple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love ios   sms  delivered  and share contact in sms it is most thing i missing in ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,open source  platform  and close source  platform  both have advantages and disadvantages  on one hand you get access to resources while other pay for it   when it comes to privacy updates and security patches without a single doubt close source platform in terms of customization open source  platform  in terms of peace and harmony close source  platform should i provide further details and insights
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,start app development and you will start dissing ios no matter who you are 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no on the ecosystem you  flipped bruv thats a clear win to android  cant win the iphone just bcz it builds walls around its ecosystem i mean thats admiring it keeps people dumb  facetime isnt big of a deal  video calls are just a thing imessages is just a message app android has tones but the connectivity to all ur home appliances bruv the android provides is big fluidity acros these devices  a clear winner honestly u had to be biased a bit  i mean why judge acording to benefits in the us instead of all around
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the fact that security isnt mentioned at all is a tremendous joke   excitement  got a category and you didnt mention that walking around with an android is like walking around with your wallet open 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,yhe storage and dex knowing i can turn my galaxy into a functional pc  cbox or gefotce now console is what made me go with samsung  i also wanted a high refresh rate screen at the time 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios has better encryption and wont give big gov backdoor access  and android is open source and they have 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone screen and battery are their selling points 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well you missed ai  there google will grow and grow that has nothing to do with phones at all  it just sits in phones  imagen how apple would have to try to compete just to sell their phones  the ai is gonna go crazy and you should make a note of that 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this really misses quite a lot of things  i think this is more accurately ios vs android than iphone vs android   if we actually compare iphone to android then you have to take into consideration hardware options  on the iphone side there is a limited selection but they are available basically anywhere in the world  on android there is a vast  vast catalogue  sometime too overwhelming even  at a very diverse range of prices  and many of these are not available in many regions   overall  regardless of if ios is better than android  which i dont think it is but lets just say for argument  my choice has always been android just because of the vast quantity of options that fit my needs   that also comes with the drawback that there is no guarantee that two to three years from now the company that made the phone i like and have today will make a followup whereas we can say for certain there will always be an iphone  well  almost certain  and for the near future 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,id much rather use an iphone but the only thing keeping me on my samsung is apk side loading
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would say that google ecosystem is better than apple ecosystem  i use both 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,please dub in hindi sir 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android users are always thinking of iphone users  how their phone is superior to iphone  megapixels  customization etc etc  always this in mind    well  on the other side  iphone users don’t even think if android guys exist 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i like my devices being mine and allowing me to do whatever i want with them  to the limits of the technical capacity of the hard  and software  apples locked down handholding babying walled off restricted way of doing things  the entire reason their usability is so high  is a complete deal breaker for me  its android all day every day  and if linux on pc could get its shit together id drop windows in a heartbeat for the same reason 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,went from iphone  to the samsung fold  after  years with apple  theres really no debate  samsung is way better  the fact that you can customize your phone and play roms without having to jailbreak is enough  if samsung phones still came with an sd card slot oh boy i wouldnt want to hear anything about an iphone  he likes to be the middle ground  but the only argument for iphone is that its an iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lets be honest   iphone is sickening the users   and easy to use goes to ios   u gotta be kidding me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,m apps on playstore  how much do we use  the same  apps for ever   xd
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is superior
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,people already voted they are buying more iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios is like pushing a bugatti  android is like riding a bugatti
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the fact that he didnt mention price kinda pissed me off  and no kids apple being higher in price is not a good thing 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,note to software updates   you can get at  years of promised software updates from fairphone  so for example their newest fairphone  will be supportet at least until   and for example the fairphone  which launched  got software support till  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its a personal opinion  nothing more and nothing less  everybody can decide it on their own 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use is a bs category  that was there to give apple a chance ease of use = tech challenge
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one more point regarding customization is not inside the phone but outside  the range of phone cases available for iphones is on next level  thats one factor which excites me and hold me to move to samsung ultra where i find cases a bit boring  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i changed from droid to apple  i prefer apple idc what android fanboys rage about on this video  it’s sad that he has to tiptoe around the subject to keep their fragile feelings from breaking  form fitting  best optimization  better battery  faster phone  greater refresh  better camera  crisper apps  the list goes on  the phone is more premium and when they do implement features they are better used than on android phones  throwing features together on a phone most people won’t use as mid  optimizing them and giving them a cool gimmick is why apple is superior 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about the antenna quality that sets samsung phones streets ahead of iphones and the reason france banned the  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont agree here  ios of course have everything but there will be no way apple can be a match with world of android  simply you can get everything android offers just for   that that offers everything an apple products offers you  top it up for   you can get an android device that offers more than the best apple device  i see apple as a public enemy brand who just wants your money and offers nothing  and they are very successful  there are many people on the earth  special ones never use the 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,people paying   + for a phone is insanity yet
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,good  balanced video  im android  live in germany  and i really dont want an iphone as i like the phones ive had and i really have a personal bias against apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i was a loyal android user but i bought iphone  a while ago and it’s the best experience i’ve had with a phone until now 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you left out the green bubble shaming category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the real winner  depends on the game being played here  the technocracy wins  the oligarchy wins  the citizens lose  the last thing anyone needs is a better phone stealing all their privacy  life  culture  friendships  time  and critical thinking skills 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im surprised that no one mentioned face id  i always have trouble with fingerprint sensors on android and apple devices  face unlock on my huwei mate  pro unfortunately only works for unlocking the phone regardless that this is a true d face camera  but the iphone on the other hand unlocks everything by face  the device  the app store  several banking apps  password managers  you name it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple does have ease of use  in which i like  android allows you to post  to  minutes fb story videos in one clip without it splitting  whereas apple won’t  also android is much cheaper  you can get a bigger screen phone with android and pay lesser money  apple text messaging and facetime is better  apple has also has better apps  apple phones works better for business purposes  the winner for me is both  i have to have android because i post music videos onto my fb story that last  to  minutes  apple phone won’t let me do that  i use both phones  i use them both equally  but for me  if i had to pick one  it would probably be android  because it’s cheaper  you get a big screen phone for a fraction of the price  and it’s more flexible 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,aps category can never  like never ever go to apple  here are just a few reasons    there are millions of hardware manufacturers  all over the world that want to their devices to be controlled wirelessly via apps  dishwashers  heaters  coolers  speakers  lights  medical equipment  scooters  garage doors  and many many more  you can publish your app a zillion times easier and cheaper and faster in  google play  than in  app store  whereas apple is hugely limited on this part  only expensive and well known brands even take the effort to develop apps for apple     you can buy a new decent performing android phone for     usd and use all the google play but you can never buy an apple phone for less than  usd so the number of installations is significantly less    ecosystem   connecting literally any and every android capable device to an android phone is much easier  performs better  is faster than to an apple device  and only recently did apple make their devices accessible to android devices  lets not again talk about the prices  every and any android based device accessory that matches the apple device accessory price  performs better on both android and apple devices   just an opinion 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,seems like an absolutely massive category is missing  one that absolutely smashes the other categories into irrelevancy   possible value for money  im not made of money 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive been an android user for the past  years with all the s series of samsung  and last year i bought iphone  just for the camera  now  after a year  im going back to android with the pixel  pro  i was not happy for a year with the iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android install anything easily
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i really like to see if this video updated with latest iphone with type c  the features is now comparable with android phone     just my two cents
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,girls scoring system    ecosystem  apple done 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the iphone is horrendous  if your screen cracks your phone is basically going to go to shit  has happened to me twice already  my screen cracked   not even bad  then my service was unavailable after  weeks  then wifi was unavailable  after my phone is paid off going to go to android lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you should consider playing some like music in the back round so its not just you talking bc tbh love your vids but its a little monotone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i need a must have feature  call recorder  why iphone lacks it free   or why not  inbuilt 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,but one thing you didnt mention is that a lot of iphone features were borrowed from cydia back in the day   are still used today 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i wish i could see like to dislike ratio for this video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, why do you have an iphone  because i want a phone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wtf  comparing iphone  a piece of hardware  with android  a piece of software 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why would you pay thousands of dollars for a phone that has everything that the competitor has and is  times better 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,easy of use should be given to android  considering the ease of file transfer to any device  any format  ios ease of use is confined to the apple environment mostly  whereas android is easy to use regardless of the  system at the recieving end  thats the fundamental when it comes to ease of use
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what if all android phones companies merge together with all their strengths   it just comes down to literally android vs apple  like say pixel vs iphone   i think thatll be some insane competition  id definitely be team android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im glad i made the switch to google pixel  i love it
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great comparison  very insightful 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you talked alot about the apple ecosystem and the samsung ecosystem  but nothing on the google ecosystem  pixel phone  pixel tablet  chromecast notebook  pixel watch  pixel buds  google home  google drive  etc  apple placing high walls in their ecosystem is good if youre already locked in  but if you value freedom and customizability over blue bubbles then googles ecosystem is heads and shoulders better 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nah ease of use do not goes to iphone because you need tutorials for even unlocking the phone using the phone for the first time
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,huawei made best android phone  not samsung  google 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have an iphone  and when i downloaded ios it totally messed up my data  if i’m not on wifi  it’s   if i am able to use the internet regardless of how many bars i have  it’s an endless cycle of updating software too much  too fast just to trap us into buying the latest and greatest phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,your categories did not include two of my most important considerations when buying a phone   security and privacy   the last few phones have all been iphones because i think they are more secure and privacy is better with apple   i used to buy androids but switched when my kids and all their friends had apples   and after that it just seemed the iphone was more secure and i have stuck with them for that reason 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,yeh i kind of outgrew the customisation thing back in windows xp    like  sure it’s fun  but you get to a point where nothing is better than a clean  stock skin  now  if this was available across a ‘range of themes’ or something  i’d probably switch to android  but the other thing holding me back is  ios just works for me  it’s easy  simple  clean  i’ve not had to worry about security   yes  i know  i know  this effects all platforms   the only phone that interests me from android is the nothing phone  especially when you hear the creator talk about ‘receiving the same amount of information’ whilst looking less at the screen
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,andriod wins in my book
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,sorry  but you forgot the elephant in the room called price  this is major and the key reason why android was able to take over worldwide sales from apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,trying to shop for a new phone is driving me absolutely bonkers  my current phone is   eight  years old  i am not sure what features are most important to me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i will  take android as the winner bro andoid is more durable and comfortable to use than the ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,pour moi léco système cest vraiment une question de point de vue  peu de monde travaille sous mac os et donc connecter un iphone à windows est une vraie galère  il est facile de partager un album photo google mais impossible de partager un album apple sur autre chose que icloud  whatsapp nexiste toujours pas sur ipad  cest assez étonnant ce que je vais dire car jaime les produits apple et en particulier macos  mais pour moi liphone est devenu le moins bon produit dapple  je regrette uniquement lapp store où la qualité des applications est globalement meilleure  sachant que quelquun qui veut un téléphone à la philosophie iphone sous android prend un pixel 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well some can very  for me  excitement depends on how it is  not its form  folding phones   ive heard those can break  gaming phones   the iphone  pro technically achieves that so im giving excitement to iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the winner is not the phone  but the friends we made along the way 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,get over it  none buys android phones if they have plenty of cash  android is for broke people who dont have anything to secure so they dont need security   yes  come at me with all you have babe  here i am 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its our money and we can buy any phone  thats not an issue  we watched the video to decide the software platform 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the apple airtags is a massive feature  using all iphones that are around to find an item is incredible useful   yes before switching from android i tried tile 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,also musician apps are more on iphone some are not existent on android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont use any apple product not because they are not good or even top of the line  i dont use them because i feel like i have to get permission from a dead man to use it the way i want to use it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you did a good job
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone of course 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro choose not to war and i  we  everyone is happy  this really differs from person to person  you cant put your personal opinion  for all the people around the world  cause everyone has different taste  different priority  different way of use   like im not a fan of camera or vlogging  i kinda person who checks all the notification from lockscreen and has about  patient to rest my phone a whole  hr only for charging  so  for me i prefer andriond over iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i tried iphone twice  got the x  and ive had the  pro max  both phones i sold in  or less months after getting them  hated the x  and  iphone generations later  it was still embarassingly similar to the same experience 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i like how apple actually listened and added usb c and a x telephoto lens to the iphone   hopefully fast charging is next in the  series
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as a music nut and audio geek there is no question   i have an sd card full of all my music as wav or flac files that i can just move to my new phone when i get one  no sd card slot on iphone because apple wants to control the storage so they can charge us for it  what about connecting to headphones or to a home audio system with a headphone jack to stream content from apps aforementioned sd card  iphones dont have that  okay  its getting pretty hard to find android phones with   mm jacks now too  but at least the aptx and ldac codex are hard to distinguish from wired connections  but apple only does aac which is very distinguishable from a wired connection if you are in a quiet room listening to a good system or headphones  the lack availability of expandable storage and a headphone jack  or at least the better bluetooth codex are an absolute deal breaker and the reason why i dont even consider an iphone when shooing for  a new phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,an ios treat you like a user  an adroid treat you like an admin
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dude forgot one of the most important categories  price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well discussed  competition benefits us all 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,after having a couple android phones i will never have any again  iphones are so much easier and integrate in a system better 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the problem with android software updates are the us carriers  the android manufactures obviously get paid to allow carriers like tmobile to have the freedom to choose what phones get updated and what phones dont  there have been countless times that multiple lg phones ive owned where an android update was passed to tmobile but tmobile sat on it for months and by the time tmobile got around to pushing the update a new version of android is right around the corner keeping the phone always one step behind  t mobile gets paid big money to put apps like mcafee on your device 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im an apple and android fan  ive got iphone  pro max  pixel  pro and s ultra  they all got something i love  i must say  i use the iphone for when im out and about everyday use  and the s for when i use xreal vr glasses because of dex  and the pixel  pro for indoor photos and i use it in bed  when i put the iphone to charge  love the ui in both ios and pixel os  not so much one ui as it hasnt got a very pretty ui even though it has a lot more features 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no back button  stupid af apple  not being able to transfer your photos and data to a pc when you have an iphone  criminal  i currently have an iphone  so there you have it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is a cult  and android is for the individual 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its simple  apple cost too much to not give more options  ill stay with android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you know whats funny  i have a galaxy note  plus a  flagship from samsung and a friend of mine have the new iphone   we took photos from my phone and his  i shit you not guys its not much of a difference the night mode is much much more better on my phone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i had an android for  years but then switched to an iphone because i wanted blue text for college  cant say i can go back to android now  i have become an apple sheep 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’m listening to this on an iphone  with galaxy buds
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about a privacy   security category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im tired of these videos  die hard iphone mac user who loves the feeling of superiority apple products give him  reviewing another android phone version he will never set his tiresome iphone down for  lets face it  if you didnt have android phones  what would you talk about  the titanium band on the latest iphone  its comical  my friend has a mac  and shes so proud of it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,sure ive had apps crash on iphone but they are way more reliable and stable than android  i stop buying android once meizu started removing their headphone jack and memory card slot
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i can easily add tb of memory to my android  is that possible on iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,over i prefer android but i too use both  daily  there is many things each does that i like more on one or the other 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me anyway  its all about the car experience and  sadly  android appears to have forgotten about it while apple is about to release a potentially game changing new version of carplay   its the only reason i use an iphone but its a huge factor  so im surprised you didnt discuss it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  just because apple stores are everywhere doesnt mean that they have better customer service it just means they have a lot of stores  when i went to an apple store about an issue with the software and the phone itself they try to sell me a brand new phone my guy that is not good customer service thats just a salesman  i permanently switch to google they have a much better experience 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,that why kphd is the king
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont buy apple as a matter of principle  the last time i bought apple products were  newtons  which are now paper weights   btw  i thought you were into apple products  marques  that was why i stopped viewing your yts  until today 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think the ease of use thing is kind of overstated  i find actually finding things in ios to be nightmarish  because of apples minimalist design many options and buttons just dont tell you how to interact with them or what they do  the example of you pulling down the bar from the top is perfect  in android most of those options are actually labelled  i think for someone who has never touched either they are probably equivalently easy to use   in terms of support  i think its important to note that for power users an android phone will be usable for far longer  when apples planned obsolescence starts to kick in there isnt very much you can do about it  but with android you can switch over to a still supported lighter version of android which runs fine on your phone and doesnt intentionally throttle it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me only  android  im android user at  and now 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i pay  dkr for  month or my pxiel  pro with a charger  and telefon services   my girlfriend is going to pay around  dkr every month for  month just for the phone with no contract   so it is a winner for me   andriod all the way 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me customization features are more heavy for this argument  and android has easy mode features
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it’s pretty cool how you put opinion for us out there in specs and use of what we like   hell yeah 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung ecosystem is great outside the us
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its like shopping  before buying something determine if its a want or a need  then say to yourself  can this phone meet all the needs in my checkbox  can it do everything that i need for my everyday life  there are some things apple does better than android  and some things android does better than apple  after that  ask yourself does your personal privacy and security matter to you  because each of these companies have very different business models on how they use your personal data  so do your research peoples  then after that focus on the wants 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,laughs with nokia 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about camera quality  speed  durability 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is the most unbiased review i have ever watched especially on  categories he point out  since ive been an android user for my entire life and planning to switch to ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios is more refined and user friendly more secure  better updates 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,performance and privacy settings is the one reason i will never buy another android phone  all the ones you brought here are also very important but i have to agree  this is so personal for each one of us
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the best comparison 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,screen quality goes to samsung
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hardware goes to apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,material quality and durability were absent  the potato chip esque fragility of apple phones  is a non starter to say the least  working in manufacturing  nearly everyone who has that fruity phone  has had at least one broken screen  my fold is still going strong  and my pixel a 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  price  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the iphone is for people who want an aesthetic phone and easy to handle  on the other hand  android is for more experienced and demanding users in terms of options and customization  for my part  i stick with android as my main one  but i have an iphone  that i use as a secondary phone for different tasks  there is no need to fight  you just have to know that both systems are for different people 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,maybe we are not all rich people and buy things that dont cost an arm and a leg
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have some additonal categories for future version of this    repairability sustainability   price   freedom data ownership
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the biggest issue with iphones i have is the stupid price  than ios updates designed to drain older iphone   but because of point    i am forced to upgrade   years because battery just start to die less than  hours   this sounds silly but outside us iphones cost   in saying that honestly user experience and ecosystem of apple blows andriod out of water  and funny thing is i am spec geek when it comes to pc   but for phone i just want simplicity and fluidity 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,do such system for phone selection  not for apple vs world 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps category to apple

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the winner is us  i totally agree
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you know what you are doing  get android  if you dont know what you are doing  get an iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,now that there is the google pixel  that should have  years of software updates wouldnt the update support point go to android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,most cheapest android phone less than a   has a much better call and message spam filter than an   iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,more like samsung vs apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i just switch my  year old parents to samsung galaxy  ultra  they have been iphone users for at least the last  years  they love it  mostly operating system  functionality  ease of use 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,youre absolutely   wrong   and its not just because im team android   apple absolutely has better eou  and updates support   however you absolutely wrong about apps and ecosystem     ill explain why   as acknowledged android has twice as many apps   now where we disagree is quality   you can always find an equal to or better app on the play store simply by using youtube reviewers   i challenge you to find a single app for a flag ship android not a potato thats lacking   more importantly android has open source development for things you cant talk about without losing your funding   such as pirating apps which lets be realistic the number  reason people use android   from downloading torrs for all sorts of software including running aaa consoles on devices such as asus  red magic  black shark  to streaming netflix and hulu without paying a premium   not to mention more tools for developers   powe users   the eco system again is matched alone by say pixels   but android has the advantage of rd party devices for headphones and smart watches that have more features than stock pixel and ios   you just have to actually do your own research because there are ofc lemons   which again goes back to eou     essentially if youre a basic user who doesnt use your phone other than basic calling  messaging   camera  go with the iphone   your dumbass cant fuck it up   if youre an actual power user who uses a phone to its full potential than android beats ios  times out of    not to mention the hardware on the global markets   were talking gb ram hz built in cooling fans  bumper triggers  duel os software   nothing on the us market even touches it   let alone the lowly iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,meh  money generation video  good work 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,personally  i use both operating systems and both have their pluses and minuses  at the end of the day  it comes down to which operating system you feel comfortable the most 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot to give a comparison on security issues
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,also where is security
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,but you are comparing one brand with so many others 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i agree with all your picks except for ease of use  this is sooo subjective  as someone who has never owned an iphone i sometimes struggle to use my sisters phone  apple has learning curve  like not having a universal back button  that might not be visible to life time apple users and vise versa with android  i think the phone you have been using the longest will be the easiest phone to use for you 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think this is the best video you have ever made most insightful for sure 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i was an early ios user until the iphone   then switched back with the iphone   its not that people dont want to switch its that they cant  transferring photos is a hassle  native ios apps are glitchy  and the lack of a universal back button  with each app having its own  is frustrating  the phone feels sluggish due to animation latency  its disappointing to see ios  once a leader  now lagging behind 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lol come on sometimes i think content people get paid for this staff  no way apple won those cartegories

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is great in many aspects  but the system font roboto is ugly compared to ios  i wonder why google cannot let third party apps use product sans font  thats a big mistake in terms of consistent user experience 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,love your videos  just wanted to add that ios doesn’t have scheduled texting  i’m switching to android just for that option 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,that’s great great video but i think you’re missing a category called longevity  i used to use android to two years  i would have to buy a new one  then i switched to the iphone  and i’m still using it and plan to continue doing so 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me its what game console does the majority have to play with ur friends family  iphone is the winner  imessage and facetime with a top notch camera  android user for  years going to buy my first iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the winner is the mobile phone that gives you what you need at a cheap price with the freedom to download whatever you want and from anywhere  therefore  the winner in my opinion is the android system without a doubt and not the iphone  which is just a jail and you are chained inside
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use better on ios  imagine having to open system setting just to access specific apps setting  imagine having to save photos as files first just to send photos as document without losing any quality  imagine you cant see any contact photos in call logs  it takes more steps to put cursor inside the word while typing  imagine having to open system setting to change specific volumes  opening hotspot is full of hassles 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,can yall drag and drop on ios yet  or do u still need hungry hungry itunes 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,beautifully done   my wife and i are on both sides   me  being a bit more tech savvy  am an android user  and my wife  an iphone user  i can now quantify the why  even more clearly 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i use both  and i dont like apple   most anoying is  no back button  and texting takes longer  mixing languages and correcting wrong written words 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,all his content is pretty lame good image quality but lame
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android has what is called the autonomy to do whatever the user wants   however the iphones  freedom to do whatever doesnt go unfettered
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you shouldve mentioned rooting  installing custom roms  and apks that allow you to download non play store apps on android  custom roms can get you more than ten years of updates for you phone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i really love marques intro music
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,keeping my pitchfork handy and watching this video as i peer out from my foxhole on the android side of no mans land  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple doesnt have file management  for that reason alone  i see no way that an iphone would work for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dear apple what jappened to my headphone jack and fingerprint sensor 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dislike  video for fools  why are these comparison criteria  why is there no  price  comparison criteria 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,simplicity is a massive thing for me  if it is easy to get to an app that i want to use  i am less likely to forget what i am meant to be doing  some other big wins with iphones for me are the keyboards and the screen recording feature  i used to use a samsung phone but my tiny hands love my iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i couldnt play pokemon blue on iphone  im forever android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android= vs ios= so basically im screwed 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for years going through the airports i enjoy watching all the iphone owners huddled next to a plug trying to get a small charge  as far as apple updates who wants an update that they throttle your phone down 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i wish apple would allow me to pick my own bubble colors for messaging and an easier way to change and add fonts  android definitely has it better with customization 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,pixel  pro or iphone  pro max  both are renewed  like new at the same price
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung dex just topples all the apple eco system
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  focus mode is already on redmi phones for like over a year
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,although  i would agree that iphone back in the day of early android would be  easier to use  that is by far not the case anymore  copy and paste  merging contacts from other devices  navigating chrome versus safari  even chome on iphone isnt very good  being able to swipe on either side of the phone to go back  the notification tray  and the keyboard are all better on android  ive used both extensively and android is hands down easier to use  even for my  year old mom whos used both 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one is yours  after all  u paid  it…  the other one belongs to a dead guy  and u can only use it as he allowed u to 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,calyx os beats both

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,good video  bro speaking of apps   i hit  times the like button for this video until it finally goes on  and that is android and samsung in a nutshell   a £ device and the latest flagship tablet  it maybe youtube app issue   who knows  but still my  years old iphone doings the job effortlessly
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in terms of ecosystem like you said with imessage and facetime  android is almost completely locked away from it i remember i would get added to imessage groupchats on my android and thered be multiple features i couldnt access  and ive recently switched over to iphone while still also using an android device because my parents have a shared custody and my dad doesnt let me bring my phone  iphone  from my moms so i have an android at his house whih is the s  and ive found a lot of times people arent very willing to give out numbers or anything especially if you have an android mainly because it feels uneccasary  i say this because iphone has gamepigeon  facetime  other stuff like that while like i said earlier android is locked away from these features 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple should discontinue the ipad mini and make a damn flip phone  an iphini  iphone and ipad mini into one   options gb storage or  gb storage starting at   charger sold separately at   for w and   for w 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the cia government
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,we are apple user even you    so stop bring in you chanel the name and roid roidand 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as much as i want to switch to an android phone  remembering that it will be hard to sync with my imac makes me reluctant to do so
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im gettin a new phone in coming months and i simply just cant decide wich one to get  s ultra or iphone  pro max  i never owned an iphone in my life  was always samsung user since the birth of smartphones and well i have this huge desire to get an iphone but on the other hand i like s ultra also a lot with the price being almost the same  wich one to get in the question 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,that shirt youre wearing is dope 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i like android because it offers me more freedom to use it how i want  also  as a linux user  i can plug my phone into my pc and drag and drop files onto it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would have added security as one of these categories   as for me it is the most important thing   security and privacy  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you didnt mention price  the apple ecosystem while nice it is very pricey  in europe and south america android has most market share for example 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,just use both 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro mixed eased of use and ecosystem and calls it a fair fight   dude  what were you on writing this vid   you dont even talk about how closed apple ecosystem is while android is a lot more about freedom  sure it comes at a price of being maybe less accessible to some  which i can understand  but although i agree overall with your arguments i just think that its very narrow minded to think this way when it comes to ecosystem 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i just subscribed to you because you are an android user  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,both companies following 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,issues i face is   apple has me hooked due to ultra watch   i would love to go back android but wont work with my watch   that sucks  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i  did watch and subscribe to this video    and i did buy samsung galaxy a g cellphone when brand new and after  years becoming becoming necessary to buy a new iphone pro max  for an emergency backup cellphone    and this android expert needs and  learning the transition    and my android is getting totally de googling   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love how so many youtubers use the  because im in the us  argument  the world is a heck of a lot bigger  and android is used by a hugely larger percentage globally 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,where is the back button for iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,do anybody want to keep accept jesus christ as tour savior he want to give u love peace and happiness and joy and salvation and eternal life if u confess your sin
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android makes it possible to own a phone with good features without paying a fortune  not everyone has the financial means to pay   for a phone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  anyone have a link to that wallpaper or the name 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,to be honest i dont like iphone because  one you have to go back to the main screen by pressing the circle button on the phone itself like he said android phones are way better more easier to navigate on id give  ios a  they are just copying what samsung has aka meaning android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,like honestly when was the last time you saw people lined up to get the next android phone  but people always line up to get the next iphone so that right there should tell you which is better
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,actually android no longer has headphone jacks they copied iphone and took away the headphone jack
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,fyi the iphone  is out and it has usb c charging
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i will be so pissed if android comes out on top
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,muy buenos tus videos bro 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i tried moving to apple   and failed miserably  how do i go back  what happened to the calls i made last week  and then whatsapp  and  the keyboard  aiyayai  couldnt do it  no split screen  and no clipboard  and the filing system 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  that’s a lie kinda o  you have like  apple apps that are installed on your phone and most you don’t use
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,forgot the most important one price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps  well 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot one option  samsung dex    iphone is coming out with a descop version   but i can connect up to  storage devices  that means i can connect up to   tera to  terabyte ssd drives   transfer and back up videos and photos as well as documents to those drives   i can also connect to a scanner and printer  or an all in one  though printers are going on their way out   i can also connect using the dex doc to an either net port     with the various dex docks they range from cheap  to expensive  there is also rumors that in some cases  some docs could incorrperate additional ram in the future    the dex docks for those who are wondering what that is the best way to describe i it is  just like when you up grade a pc  you have pc slots  so the dex docks are like many pci slots  only usb   is much faster then a traditional pci slot    with the desktop up and running  i have had people from various cooperations stating  where did i get that computer from  then i show them it is my phone     all in all you did a great job  but you didnt cover the features and abilities    samsung dex is deffintly improving  and when the devices like s  ultra and s  ultra comes out  this will make the phones  micro computers  it can be said that the s ultra is a micro computer in of itself   i think  were coming in to an era where the lines will be blurred   where os of both apple and iphone will take on more computer features   we could see in the future phones with multi ports as well as a new screen interface   one that could resemble much more like a tablet or actual computer interface    i for see a time where our devices be it apple or android  samsung  will become micro computers capable of doing a lot    from gaming  to office  to video editing and such    also it appears microsoft is really destroying windows  were also entering in to the rth industrial revolution   who knows what we might get   we might even get an os that is totally ai 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, both teams played hard 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,while i like the samsung  i must admit  i like the safety of the iphone   for example  when i had a samsung  i pushed an update on it and the thing shut down and never came back up   that was after having it for a couple of years   i’ve had my iphonex since it came out  and i don’t have that problem   i know eventually i will have to get a new phone   however  it is nice to not have to buy a new phone the very next year   also i don’t have to worry about viruses and bad actors
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what if i don’t care none of them  i only have a phone since people asked why i didn’t had a phone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,to be honest tho i do think that allot of the customisation on android is pointless
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,can you share with us some of that money that apple payed you for on this video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i personally think build design and hardware should have in the list of factors as well  also the price factor   as not everyone can afford an iphone easily  they charge a bit extra than most android phones 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,whenever someone tries to do something technical at work   pulls out an apple it reminds me of a child trying to help you cut paper with plastic scissors  simple os for simple people
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i cant live without a stylus  ive had both operating systems  i mean come on apple charges for space  thats ridiculous  its android and its not even close  i understand people who like apple because they are comfortable with it but in terms of the phones overall abilities  its so not close its not even comparable  its like k to nba live 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps was kinda wrong imo i get that there are exclusive apple  apps but in general androids have everything you need and more with apks albeit less supported and secure 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how do i dislike this out of touch video more than  time
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you shouldve placed price as to be considered  paying xxxx amount for the same shit you can get with xx  so yeah if you have any control over your pocket  you would pay double the price to have half an apple at the back of your phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lot of the pro apple arguments seem to be very us centric  i feel like it really depends on the region and how widespread is the support for various android brands  in my country  i feel apple support is crap compared to   pretty much anything else  people also use messenger and whatsapp  so blue vs green messages is a non discussion  i could probably list more  but you get the idea 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nice
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its a nice feature to have focus mode but at the same time it is very limited  it is not possible to select a complete contact list to mute  you have to select each contact invidually and the maximum amount of contacts you can select is pretty limited if you want to mute your whole organizatio in your free time  focus mode is cool but still limited 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i use both  but if i had to choose  i would only use iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hi i’m apple  we purposefully inject code into your software updates to slow your device way the heck down to entice you to buy our newest as latest product that you already were using but we just renamed it to the next number aka iphone   we have no customization what do ever  we force people to bully android users and not allow users to send or receive high quality android messages so we can brainwash the user into not talking to their android family members  we also had  major security breaches in the last  weeks  one with imessage malware code and imessage being accessed by android people  even though they weren’t doing it for evil intent  us apple people want to make it seem like it is because we don’t like when android users can have a fun time with our users 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont think its that personal at all  the way i look at it is if google went under   no more google  society is f ked  if apple went under  life continues  think about it  from search  maps  youtube  google is such a big part of daily life  whereas apple is meh  just apple  there is no competition  the only reason to get an iphone nowadays is just so you can say you have one  like you said  theyve both matured to a point where they mimick each other   with android setting the pace  apple holding on to their ecosystem just complicates things if you ask me they should just start making android phones  they might as well they already use all the apps 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use definitely goes to android  i had to google how to navigate on an iphone  whereas on android  there are just buttons on the bottom of the screen
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you also cant unlock your phone with a thumbprint on the screen with iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there was a point in time where apple was the clear and obvious winner  after all they spearheaded the smartphone revolution  id say somewhere around iphone  i switched to the htc one and have been on various androids ever since  i like the customization it offers and the exciting innovations in form factor  its nice to try new things  switched from oneplus back to pixel to try out the new fold and its awesome  iphones are excellent phones  and very popular  does matter to some  with a coherent ecosystem that gets good support  id be crazy to say android is clearly better  its not cut and dry in either direction anymore  and i think thats good for everyone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i swear the first version of android has more customization than the latest iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for those picking iphone for ease of use  go back to a flip phone  smartphones are about features
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is over rated  not even a debate
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i am an android user and probably always will 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you are creative   android if you are dumb  iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why does apple always get a  slight  edge in a catagory  but the androids wins are  by far  the best 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think i have to disagree with the updates support round going to iphone  sure  the iphone r gets official updates  but with android youve got custom roms  the samsung galaxy sii from  just got android  for example  thats  years of updates 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple phones cant capture big market like india   very basic   apple phones lack complete language support  in whole of india of >  crore people  apple phone only support hindi display  other languages   major languages tamil  telugu  kannada  malayalam and other very big india languages are ignored  this is more than   years since languages became standard in android  biggest shame is a few years back a telugu character caused the phone to hang  this is enough to for people not take apple  the company is too arrogant to the market needs  over   of the indian market remains ignored due to this corporate arrogance  must be similar in other countries which have multiple languages  the apple phone will support some  elite  language and ignore the rest of the market   forced region restriction  apple apps cannot be installed in the  wrong  country  android apks and playstore apps can be unofficially installed anywhere in the  wrong  country   paid apps for free   modified apps in the form of apk files can be installed in android  this is impossible in apple   external storage eg  tb sd card   apple phone dont have it   bluetooth compatibility   apple phones have some problems trying to transfer files to any device through bluetooth   local news customization  dont even know if any bigshots in apple know what this means   you set the phone to your preferred language  over  languages natively supported  you get the entire os  news  even ads customized to that setting    servicing replacement cost   cost of replacement of apple display is many cases is more than a new android phone    back button is not there in iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,google pixel ecosystem will be better in a few years  trust me

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,el iphone si tiene carga reversible  desde el   solo que viene limitada a hacerlo solo con su battery pack magsafe  hoy en día la carga reversible a sido liberada  pero solo vio cable con el usb type c

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think in a world where people don’t even use normal cameras these days and just use their phones  i think cameras should’ve been a separate category  sure you covered that in features  and android clearly won there  but if there was a separate camera section  android would have been the winner there too perhaps   posting from an iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive had an iphone since the iphone  came out  and i am finally switching to android  its not that the iphone isnt great  but i am tired of having basically the same phone for so many years  i am ready to switch it up  and these flipping   folding phones look like so much fun  plus for me personally the app market is better on android than iphone  iphones manga apps are absolutely terrible  and these days i prioritize stuff like that way more than social media or god forbid the stupid green bubble debate   cheers 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me  my perspective on apple vs android has changed over the past  months  ive had iphones since i was   for reference  im now   but i plan to make the switch when the s comes out  up to this point  the ecosystem has been my top priority by a wide margin  however  since i got out of college and started my career about a year ago  the ecosystem doesnt matter nearly as much to me anymore  whenever i was in high school  and especially in college  having the seamless pairing of airpods to my phone was a big deal  now  i almost never wear my airpods  i listen to music at home mostly and i use my sony xm for that  being able to use my phone in conjunction with my ipad and macbook was part of my everyday life  now  i dont use my ipad and my mac stays plugged up to my monitor at home and is used as a desktop  i do love my apple watch but its the least necessary accessory for me  i can see myself going back to a normal watch  now  i dont use many apps apart from food  banking  twitter  youtube  and one of my coloring games lol  im not constantly texting friends anymore and ive never really used facetime much   in conclusion  now that ive grown up  what kept me with apple doesnt seem to matter to me anymore 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,really surprised you didnt mention androids ability to get apps from other places than the app store  thats a huge deal to really techy people  which i know isnt the majority but we still matter 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,your paid by apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android all the way 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a lot of android phones are typically cheaper then iphones and yet still compete neck to neck with iphones  thats my biggest thing next to customizing
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the ecosystem from android is better so it functions with all devices  not apple  and apple only with apple and samsung has routines  please inform before you make a video
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think globaly most people choose the next phone based on price  not everybody can afford an iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hard disagree about software and security updates   you may not count this  but i do  lineageos has a library of s of old phones that can get upwards of android   they give ota updates and all for free  plus you get root access  totally worth it if you never want to get a new phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my nokia has focus mode and it is from  years ago
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,maybe the real winner is the friends we made along the way
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone vs android   phone vs all random android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how about how overpiced apple is 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hey there  great vid   i would disagree with the ease of use cause switching from ios to android and vice versa is a pain in the ass  so i think it depends on what u are used to  i have been using android from the start and when i use an iphone its just not easy    i live in serbia  and we are not dependent on apple eco sys  here the main reason why ppl buy an iphone is the cool factor  they are spending a lot of cache buying a powerful phone just for viber  snapchat  instagram  and selfies  those selfies are filtered with some filters and looks like it was taken with htc from   but  its an iphone  d  here  the iphone is a status symbol  nothing else  quick story  kids in school are often rejected from other kids if they are not using an iphone  i remember a colleague from work saying i must buy an iphone for my kid  th grade  shes been rejected by her friends because of using an android  instead of putting the kid in another school  she is thinking of buying an iphone for the kid  crazy world these days   also  apple products are very expensive compared to android devices  so for me and ppl from here  android makes much more sense 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is the clear winner
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,complexity vs simplicity how complex do you want it to be or how simple do you want it to be thats based off each persons life  the power of apps and the choices has balanced all technology it comes down to branding 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,tammy abraham has his own youtube channel 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,unfortunately doesnt exist a cool phone right now  limits everywhere  front cam not good  lack of memory card  rear cam good but tele not so good and much more  storage  not enough for me  ram high but opening  or  app all is slow  no no  there is no one good phone right now in this world for me  what about battery  i never see a phone over  hours of my intense use never  ever  i can build the perfect one  but i dont have the budget and no one will build what i want  even is possible  idk nothing about apple beside us very expensive  so i keep it there and get one android i can much more customise  even s ultra has many limits  i think for me is actually the best chiuse even limited from samsung  they can do much more  but they dont want it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,quality over quantity made me buy an iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android all day
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about battery life  wouldnt android be far more superior at the arguably most important aspect of a given phone    and as for the quality over quantity in regards to the play app store  wouldnt a huge quality not also be the exact quantity of having a larger array of games and other apps to choose from   if so  then the winner would be android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i like both  primarily use iphone for the ease of use though   i do find it funny when a new android gaming phone comes out and last gen iphones can run circles around it  that tells you just how big of an advantage a device can have when you make the hardware and the software 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about price indicator 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in southamerica technical support of iphone doesnt work  many things in usa are different than in southamerica so our point of view are very different  thanks anyway 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the reality is that if you switch a top andoid with an iphone you will miss it  but if you do the opposite you wont  many people just buy a bad android just to have a phone  then switch it with an iphone and then say  wow  iphone is unbeatble  but if you have a s ultra  youll hate everything of ios  the unic reason to buy an iphone is that you have always been with apple or if you are a video creator  because they have much troubles on basilar thingsgrinning_face_with_sweat 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,but pixel google  years update
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how could you not include perhaps the most important comparison point  price  right from the earliest ipods  i looked past the hype and dug into the specifications to directly compare things like memory capacity and battery life to get a more accurate comparison of value for money  i have added apple products to the mix several times when buying mp players and phones over the last two decades to see if it was worth buying one  and i have never found an apple product that is even close to competitive on price  in my view  apple has always sold ease of use at a premium  if a product is better  if it is worth more  im happy to pay more  but as mentioned in the video  ease of use usually comes at the expense of customization  i am a person who learns quickly  and ive always been comfortable with navigating the complexity of new tech  whenever i get a new piece of technology  whatever it is  the first thing i do is dig into the settings to see what it is capable of and how i can customize it  i get frustrated when i want to tweak something and the option isnt available  i will take flexibility over ease of use any day of the week  in most cases  knowing that about myself  i have found that i would pretty much always take an android product over an apple product at price parity  just for the flexible customization  when the apple product is significantly more expensive  the decision is an easy one for me  my mind is always open  id be happy to someday find an apple product that i felt was worth the price  but that hasnt happened yet 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,pretty interesting video  i think there is one factor that moves people to use an iphone and it is status  people pay way more for the phones and for being in the ecosystem because it makes you more  as a consumer  than others  period  in other words  apple sells and markets its brand really well 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,very well thought out and presented video  i am a iphone user and i agree with you  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,id love to see a  which is better  video regarding security and privacy between android and ios   not only regarding how much access to our data rd party apps have  but how much google and apple themselves can scrape and sell   i know privacy is a nonissue for a lot of people   they just cant be bothered to care  but for those that do its definitely a deciding factor 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,andriod is for chronically online ppl iphone is for normal people
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is the best in my opinion 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,god dammit iphone is  the winner
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,id personally give  best ecosystem  to android  as seamless as apples options are  because of apples tyrannical control over their own software and hardware  you basically have no freedom of choice  want any accessories  well  you have about a million different choices and then the single best  super expensive  apple option  that can often even be gimped in some way  hello magic mouse 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,very good review  easy to watch and good info 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot price difference for similar phones of android and iphone  there android wins always
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love both phones for different reasons   i actually carry but phones so i have the best of both worlds 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think the big category missing here is price  yes there are android phones that are more expensive than iphones but there are many androids that are far cheaper  than the even the cheapest iphone    to go one step further than that  look at price equivalent to features  i could get an iphone with the features i want today  but it could cost me   more   these are huge factors for many people  which this video just ignores
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i personally prefer android as alot of android phones are cheaper and more efficient than iphone  plus alot of iphones use samsung chips so they wouldnt be what they are without android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it just sucks because i really really love apple way more than android but the customization is so unstoppable and i love how android is constantly evolving where apple is stagnant  its like if apple just tried an itty bitty bit harder there would be no competition 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nice vid mkbam soon set up a phone company hope u will be there to compare my gadgets with the iphone xmas
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so when we gonna stay on one side of the fence and finally get a android vs android video
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,giving apps category to ios is a joke lmao
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,jokes on apple  support now goes to android with the pp and its  years of updates 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"after purchasing my samsung z flip  phone last year  i encountered multiple screen display issues  under the assumption that these were factory defects  i sent the phone to samsung for repair  expecting it to be covered under warranty  however  to my dismay  samsung initially denied the fact that it was a factory defect  furthermore  i was shocked to learn that samsung requested a payment of   for the repair of a phone that i had recently purchased  adding insult to injury  samsung had the audacity to offer me the option to purchase a new phone while still holding onto my current phone and refusing to ship it back to me  despite my clear indication that i was willing to fix the phone myself  they disregarded my request  as a result of this disheartening experience  i have lost all trust in samsungs products and services  i have made the decision to switch to apple for my future phone needs "
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the apple ecosystem walls analogy is perfect i’ve wanted to try some android products like a phone or computer but already having the airpods  iphone  watch and macbook it’s just not a financially smart option which sucks
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the iphone is the clear winner  simply based on a single factor  reliability  ive owned three iphones  they all still work perfectly to this day  getting continual software updates helps  not happening on a droid  along with superior build quality  i had probably  or more droids  all mid level to high end  not one lasted more than  months  your results may vary  but its a no brainer to me  for that reason alone  i used to love droid  wanted nothing to do with overpriced iphones then the light came on if they last  years instead of one  they are a better value 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when it comes to a smartphone iphone does it better  android pushes features to make you think it’s some better phone but reality is it’s a phone and iphone will be the leader  the experience and quality of functionality is without doubt android just seems they rush everything and put crap on crap to make it seem they are doing more iphone is quality with the feel and experience android is not 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the pure fact that everyone can let apple get away with slowing down previous iphones to force people to buy a new one just shows apple has too much control over people’s lives  almost like dictatorship 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this guy is kind of biased lmao   iphone vs android  don’t you mean iphone vs samsung  iphone vs motorola  iphone vs google pixel   why did you compare a phone to an operating system  how are you a tech youtuber but make this mistake
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think he gave a fair assessment for the most part  he actually named what each phone types strengths and weaknesses are  though anyone could contend with some of those things  including the categories he decided to make  of course few viewers are going to agree   and i think there are important distinctions that he didnt point out  he gave the winner of most categories to iphones  but said he was an android guy  and gave the reasons why  what more do you want  you know he doesnt want to alienate either side  because that whole side would likely stop watching his videos  so  he sure as hell isnt going to bash either side  and there is no reason to bash either side  each side fits certain types of people better and is a good choice for certain people 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,man you are the best genuine  tech guy i have seen ever  love you mkbhd
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lets use common sense   closed off company  stuck in its ways thats waits till an option is perfected to implement it  or hundreds of companies that are constantly innovating  always pushing the technology envelope  ill leave you to figure out which is which 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have had an iphone for years  after they updated to   and then   both of these updates made my outdoor cams useless  the update did something to the notifications  i have been with apple support and had them take over the phone to check and they cannot adjust the tones for notifications  you are out of luck if you use blink cams  btw  its not blink  only happened after update  going android soon 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i just see a lot of people coming here and complaining about android phones  saying that after they changed from android to apple it just felt better  but it seems that noone is considering their big fact  of changing from a crap   android to a high end iphone  pro max what goes for   is a change in category   you never see someone complaining with a samsung s ultra that its laggy and buggy  cmon ppl as iphone has only good stuff  there are a lot of android phones that just dont work  you pay   to get a not even low end phone  you get what you paid for  then next year when its slow you change to a phone  worth    and you say android is sht 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android has more updates per month than iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,we should pressure the app store to be equal for all brands 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android or iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive always been team android probably just like all other brokies 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thanks dude you have cleared my lot of concepts
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios still doesnt natively support copy   paste history  android had it for years without using a rd party app  theres also no history with the native calculator app 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use apple   seriously 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the video in the end turns to comparing samsung to apple rather then comparing the two os   eco system should not be in the topic bro has nothing to do with os
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you cant add eco system kinda unfair to android because an eco system is easy to create when the ios and phones and watches and laptops are all made by the same company
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i just switched to iphone from exclusively android and specifically pixel  the biggest thing that i miss so far is the lack of universal back gesture swipe from either side of the phone like on my pixel  other than that  everything else has been pretty minor 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  apps definitely go to android  no questions asked  who cares about getting an update  days later  when an iphone doesnt have any of the apps you need or they are behind a   paywall but free on android      the first two categories are essentially the same  android should not get  points    real score   to  in my opinion 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is better cause i had an s it was good then i switch to an  pro
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the reason developers chose ios over android isnt because of what is harder or easier to program   its about how much easier it is to drain peoples wallets on the ios  thats literally it  nothing else   not sure where you got your i fos  but plenty devs even said that ios is terrible to design for because you have to exactly use apples programs which are terrible to use and force devs to purchase it   also you talked about the ecosystem and only compared samsung to apple  the strength of android is that it has many more ecosystems  if you were objective you would give it to android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android fanboys are enthusiastic  whereas apple fanboys are delusional 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what’s that stand where he turned it   and it was a calendar and watch 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,yeah  iphone is easy to use but only if you hella rich and do but care about anything outside a web browser and messenger
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i never bought into the eco system  here are what devices i use want   s ultra  camera  display  battery  samsung routines  assistant  flexibility    iphone  as backup   yrs of software updates  performance  simplicity    macbook pro  performance and reliability    sony xm  sound quality    ipad mini wifi  portability and performance    samsung watch  classic  because of its classic look 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the iphone was better when it had the button and headphone jack
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i got my galaxy s+ on the day it released and just a year ago i got the iphone  it hasn’t been  months yet and i want to throw the iphone in the trash  iphone is just not for me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,have been a samsung user most of my life  and switched to iphone i can definitely say that android are easier to use to understand and clearly straight forward     in androids they have a pause button when taking a video   customise alarm ringtones with your songs that you download   iphone ringtone are harsh    individual setting volume setting for alarm  call notifications and media  the settings allow much more features    transferring photos and videos from iphone to a laptop to empty up some space is a headache literally with androids its quick and easy   people about face time and imessage are probably like in us and canada side because here in india these two features are literally the most useless elements  we use whatsapp   i personally also think that if you are in asia then iphones have to adapt with people rather than androids 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the iphone is so popular is the u s   here in europe it is mixed   most of my friends use android devices   with samsung s series in the lead and pixel and one plus in a lesser degree   and most parents  above s year old  would use xiaomi and samsung a series   speaking of myself i am not a sucker for camera but i am a sucker for unique phones so the fold series is my choice 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphones just copying android at this point
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive said this for a loooooonggg time  iphone needs to let go of not being able to move the icons where we want them  any place on the sceen  they need to give in
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple slowing down every previous phone with their constant  software updates   apple scamming you by being more expensive for services such as youtube music compared to android youtube being cheaper  apple and how they screw android people over with their friends since iphone users will bash and kick android users out of anything since they’re a green bubble  apple and how they release overpriced products that you can’t even customize or run roms apks on since i have mario galaxy  hz at my phone  apple and how they break so easily especially iphone   apple and they’re evil business tactics by forcing you to go to their shop just to get a  battery replacement  but then that battery dies faster than older one in a few weeks
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ironically i think android gets a half point in updates now with google supporting the pixel  till   but its still google  anyone remember stadia 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive always been a samsung android phone owner  note series  and now i have the s ultra   every time i think of trying the iphone i remember how often i plug my s ultra into my windows computer and it acts like a flash drive which isnt the case with an iphone   also i have thousands of my own songs   im not sure how iphone would handle the music that i already own   going to an iphone just seems to limit me much more than my samsung so ill happily stay with android   great information in this video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,mr  brownlee   i appreciate your attention to detail and the simple explanation into deciding which phone to buy  thank you
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use and the premium feel of every animation in every app made me switch to iphone  years ago  but ios is not as solid as it used to be  not everything  just works  the control center not being able to switch wifi and bluetooth off is annoying since day   airdrop and carplay bug on a daily basis  and there was this thing where suddenly half my contacts were not able to imessage me or vice versa  it only allowed sms  on the other hand i like the reminder app for sharing lists with my family  i like imessage  with gamepigeon mini games  d  over the more popular whatsapp here  i like the shared albums in the gallery  im sure i could make the switch again  but this iphone is the longest lasting phone i ever had and im only  years in  im always scared of missing the one im leaving behind 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how qpps in on apple side you can sideload apps on android this is second reqson why i newer buy iphone first is price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,we  have   five apple  i phones  in the  house  and will never  change to android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the fact that you can buy an android for literally half the price with a camera thats just not quite as good is huge   also  apple phones will only work with other apple products when android you can use it with anything   except apple of course 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thank you for your video  im just right now at the crossroads again for my next phone  my problem is   i really prefer android on the phone  but apple watch over the android watches  sadly apple watch doesnt work well with android so  a loss either way  im still undecided
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im not sure  apps  should go to apple  given one of the most used apps for communication there is   whatsapp   is simply  trash  for iphones  i say it in   because its of course still usable but with so many features either removed or made unlogical  however granted im not up to date with if if was made better in the last  years since i tried it on an iphone but it just shows that android is not marching behind ios  or i remember my freind and i decided to play something together on our smartphones and we couldnt figure out why my freind couldnt find that one game in his store  turns out he had apple store   so we had to swtich to a worse game that we both didnt really want to play that much instead  and another  cents for the ecosystem  samsung and apple are quite expensive brands to build an ecosystem on  chinese brands like xiaomi and huawei are catching up really fast in that field and by the looks of it they are able to do it way cheaper  they still have a way to go but neither apple nor samsung  care  about the users finances and are not even trying to make their ecosystems available for us   mortals  who have limited finances 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,on updates  maybe apple has updates for a longer time but when the updates stop you get a useless brick  my samsung stopped getting updates but i was able to use all my apps  my grandmothers iphone just refused to launch some apps as it wasnt  compatible  with her older os  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,enjoyed the video  have to say the criteria weighting changes every a few years  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have used android most of my life and then went back to iphone recently and that is where i am staying if ii have to be honest with myself i truly  believe that android makes a far far superior product   the color of bubbles do not concerned me  but the simplicity of the iphone facetime and airdrop and posting to socail media is way easier with iphone  plus i already have a macbook pro   believe me me i have plenty to say about apple but thats where im staying for now 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me  when i think of android versus ios  it all comes down to freedom  i use an android  not just because i like to customize my phone  but because i like being in control of my phone and i require having my choice on which devices to use  rather than being controlled by my phone  or the company that produces it  apple is a control freak that uses cheap tactics to get and keep users  and i cant stand control freaks or people that walk the line when it comes to cheating 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ipad for home android for on the go and cellular  thats how i roll
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what a time to be alive mkbhd just gave the app category to ios  with the infinite things you can do with apks in android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,everyone knows iphone is king android is for try hards who think their  tech  is better
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung is the best  i used iphone for a decade and i have  been using samsung for a year now  i must say samsung is the best in terms of privacy  apps  camera etc
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the only category i really disagree with is the updates support category  apple has seen multiple class action lawsuits for intentionally destroying battery life with software updates to encourage people to buy new phones  that is some scummy shit  also as for apple stores being everywhere to give support  unless you have apple pay you are probably not getting your device fixed  instead youll probably end up needing to buy a new device  unless it is a computer  which honestly is terrible support  also apple is waging a war on right to repair which honestly falls under support  spare parts for android phones are easy to find and you dont need a custom screwdriver set to fix your phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,excellent video and a very helpful scoring system  thank you 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is for followers im not that 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i read all the features on every new and know by heart the ios of all the old i came into  features of different cameras   plug ins  power cords cases  where were you when i needed you  lol i had an iphone and an extra android for the huge screen game play and had it on automatic upload to newest available ios  i downloaded the app to switch brains of or add content of android to iphone they cross downloaded and continued to update each other and acco idate each other  itll be  amazing when each person could put all the features  software hard ware cases cords jacksetc  and enjoy all together
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marques trying not to offend his apple audience  its okay we know who the real winner is  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,people just choose apple because of popularity  if more celebrities had androids  people would throw their iphone away 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in regards to ecosystem  how well or not so well will iphone work with microsoft  as a pc user by default over the decades and android user by default  my old android  motorola  needs to be replaced and was thinking of iphone  specifically   as cant justify cost of new model  as seems to be a more robust system  also dont like the larger screens on most androids for carrying in pocket  but not sure how well it will work with microsoft pc or adding microsoft apps 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ok  im buying a flip  then  ill wait for the iphone  with usb c  bye bye
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i feel apple pays you money under the table  to say android phones are bad none the less constant in updates that you are the defending apple  apple ecosystem and refusal to change unless order by eu to change because apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think price is another consideration  there are no cheap iphones  then  take the pixel  a fantastic android phone for much cheaper and a much better value than any android flagship or iphone  this is another hugely beneficial result of the competitive environment of android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its getting so you cant tell the difference between a phone and a house brick 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,agreed 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i am about to switch to android from iphone   with ios  many apps crash and hang up  this happens to my iphone  pro and iphone  pro even after the  help  from genius bar  the app incl telegram instagram threads tesla app yahoo finance this really sucks
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,let’s listen to the geek himself  the father of all the you tubers critics  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i really liked you enphasized so much living in the usa  for many features  because usually these kind of videos forget usa is not the world and many features are not available or npt that useful outside
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use  iphone does not even have the universal back tap or back swipe gesture 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i was expecting android to get the win for the update category due to apple updates on phones near end of life making devices slow or run out of battery quickly
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well done sir 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i need to support many friends and family members  ios is far easier to use compared to android  android customization options are too much for many people  ios = less options means less issues    they are not powerusers  only email  chat apps and camera  full stop    long term support updates is very important for me  i had a iphone  and now iphone   before the old samsung galaxy note 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,love your vids  but a  min vid   turns out to be a min vid with ads    i get it    over anything  deuces 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,add the category of price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there are females out there that will not date you if you carry an android   do what you will with this information 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you gonna do a updated version of this now iphone  p m is out 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if youre american and dont care about your phone and just need something easy  then pick apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,let me guess  after  years  which one still alive              i guess the pixel   pro  will dead before  years 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what you have to keep in mind is the monetary issue  in latin america the iphone is extremely expensive  which is why the majority uses android  and from the cheapest to the mid range  because the high end ones are also unattainable for many 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nicley said 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i prefer ios  it was my first phone i ever got 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im pretty sure samsung  okay ig thats not all of android  has focus modes  i use the  work  and  sleep  mode on mine regularly 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,seriously though  what android phone would u say best compete with the iphone like very close and could potentially beat an iphone   we need that video  mkbhd
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,coming from a samsung phone user id say from my understanding samsung is better in every way plus we have customization and options
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i havent owned an apple device in well over a decade  but i pretty much ranked every category the same way you did  while i am personally very invested in the android system  i do like a lot about what apple does  every couple years when i upgrade to a new phone  i consider switching to apple  but im the end something new and different on an android keeps me there  ive been on the samsung ecosystem for a long time  specifically the note series from the note  on  but i just bought a pixel  pro  i really considered the iphone  but to me the just look so dull and cookie cutter since they really only have one phone with different sizes  android just offers so many different styles  looks  feels  and gimmicks  i like uniqueness too much to let all that go  i even change my launcher ever few weeks to keep my phone feeling new and fresh  which  as i understand it  you just cant do with apple  i love the simplicity and efficiency with a lot of what apple does  but i cant give up the ability to really make it my own and to keep changing it so it feels new and fresh for   years  im giving up my note  ultra after  years  but it still feels new since i can change it so often 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this whole debate is like xbox vs playstation vs pc  at the end of the day  it’s what the end user wants or feels like they need want  personally  me using both android and apple  at least i was on android for a bit  i realized that in the long run  they are the exact same phone  with different settings  different customization options  etc  im personally locked into apple now  i have the apple watch  the ipad  macbook  airpods  everything works seemsly and thats what i like about it  being able to text my friend through my laptop while in class  or even at work and not being obvious about it  ios vs android is  once again another battle i hope we finish like we did with the console wars 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i appreciate you making this video    i’ve been looking at getting a new phone  i’ve been an apple user for  years now    most of my family members have made the switch to androids due to the lower cost compared to apple    i’m still not   sure if i’ll make the switch  it would be nice if you could just get one phone and it could last you  years   maybe this would be a landline phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thats why you never get bored with android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i like the content  but i dont like the scoring system  id use  points per category to reflect how big the difference is  slight difference would be   for e  g  significant difference could be   this scoring system might lead to a completely different end result 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this video is a huge bs  hes an apple fanboy
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have a problem with being restricted after spending my money on a phone especially sideloading payed apps for free si i will always chose android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  omg shoutout to pocket casts  the best podcast app ever  id recognize that beautiful ui from a mile away 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i use both daily but honestly i hate the controlling behaviour of apple  the fact that i cant even use drops in  on a  quid  handset that i bought really is enough for me to unequivocally recommend android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have them both and i’ll take apple ios anyday  it just works  android is clunky and the spell checker is horrible 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot an important thing  repairing cost  that would make android win by a massive range
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i disagree in the apps section  in android you have the posssibility to install apks  modded apps  rooted apps  theres so many possibilities  in matter of fact  thats the reason why im going back to android  after  year of experience in ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i hate the updates  they screw up the phone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hello how can i upload the videos to social media without losing its quality   please help 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’m surprised you didn’t mention apks during the apps section  the ability to download basically any app you want  even if it has been removed from the play store has always been an advantage for android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i added a catagory called  trackability by the government 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,having the brick walled ecosystem of apple as a positive thing is baffling  its genuinely anti consumer  anti right to repair  the list goes on  want to video chat with your friend with a different brand phone  ohh you have to jump through hoops  its infuriating and why many dislike them  a lot wrong with this video  but that one stood out 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the big thing you are missing with apps is the ease of side loading apps on android   that on its own puts it miles ahead of the locked down apple environment 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,saben cual es el mejor teléfono  es aquel que mejor se adapte a tus necesidades   saludos 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nah android taking the win for apps  apple not having many apps really sucks  i couldnt find the apps that i liked on android  even if i did  it needed to be paid for
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i am heavily entrenched in the google ecosystem so it’s always the android for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me  i care the most about updates support  your phone can be a  hertz   gb ram  oled screen  phone  but if that phone does not get at least  years of guaranteed support and customer support is next to no nonexistent  im not buying your phone   there are a few  electronic stores  where i live  but only apple  out of the phone computer companies  has a physical retail location anywhere near me and luckily in my city  so i can walk in and demo the products before i commit  and their customer support is the best i ever dealt with plus i know theyll deliver on updates   if any android phone manufacturer matched that  you may have my attention  but dealing with actual representatives and seeing the product in person before buying is a strong category for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one key thing is missing   price and therefore value for money 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios copies android  all iphones look the same  they never upgrade the look  there is no such thing as privacy  i have android  on my phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is the king
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is better no doubt but poor people like me  android is there  end of the day its just a phone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is better for most users  android is better for a smaller crowd of people that are more into customization and downloading stuff
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the thing is  marques is an apple fanboy  uses ios and macos  he cant really be objective   im an android and linux user  i wouldnt be objective either 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,just my own opinion but i would add price as a category  any smartphone today is going to be expensive  but i find for what i want to do android does everything im looking for and at price which im happy to pay  again thats just my own personal opinion  overall this video is a very good starting point for anybody who is thinking about changing os  or buying their first smartphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i switched to the latest iphone then immediately back to android  felt like nothing had changed with iphone over years which mkbhd commented on in ease of use  whilst its familiar it felt boring   also felt heavily restricted in what i could do on iphone due to its user friendly interface  as opposed to all the configurations  settings  apks  launchers etc i could use on android  i think the difference in cameras are negligible unless you really care about how your photos   just not for me iphone however i respect those who use one and understand why 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me   android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, eco system  is smart way saying ignorance 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if apple could get their gestures in order id switch  its impossible to use an iphone one handed with the back button in top left 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this discussion cant be held by americans because the apple ecosystem is inescapable  the bias is unreal  anywhere else youll find people use whatsapp to contact each other and nobody has an apple to air drop them stuff  i can go on but i think the point is clear 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the one thing i can’t stand about android  is that you only get one to two years of system updates for your device   while i can’t really complain about smartphones  because most people don’t use their phones for  years like me  it is unacceptable that android tablets get such short update support  i have a galaxy pad which is flawed and aging because support ended a long long time ago   i chose an iphone this time for this reason  on the one hand it’s more powerful than i’ll ever need and will get system updates for a long time to come  but on the other hand the battery life is fairly horrific  i never had to charge my android smartphone so often when i didn’t use it much 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im a long term android user  pixel specifically  and id switched to an iphone  for about a year before switching back to pixel  this is my take    iphone certainly works well with its own ecosystem  but if youre not already invested in it  its extremely painful to work with    my workplace uses sms authentication which i have to use about twice a day to login  with a pixel my messages are available from a web browser to just copy paste the otp when i get it  with iphone  i cant do that  plus  most workplaces dont give you the option of using whatever os or computer you want  android messages can be accessed from literally any web browser    many of my old cds have been ripped into flac  to get them on android  i connect it with a cable to my pc and copy paste them over  on an iphone that doesnt support flac by default  i gotta put them on some cloud account and then import them into some third party app which is specifically designed to play flac files  even then the integration is just janky    the most important features from my pixel that i simply could not live without on an iphone are call screening and voicemail transcription  i believe theyve added the transcription thing now  but call screening is amazing when the caller is unknown and i just want the assistant to deal with them  more often than not its spam    im using sony wh xm headphones  and those just sound better over ldac when listening to flac encoded music  iphone doesnt support ldac  the sound quality difference isnt very significant  but its certainly noticeable  i was hearing a difference for sure which is why i went digging into why it doesnt sound as good as my pixel    the home screen on iphones just puke all apps onto them  its such a mess and theres no easy way to sort them  android has a clear app drawer which sorts everything alphabetically and lets you put frequently used app shortcuts on the homescreen  this is significantly cleaner    iphone does not show notification icons in the top bar  that annoyed me quite a bit  also why cant music player controls just be swiped away  these are just minor annoyances but yeah  still annoyances 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i just want peace if you like a phone then thats good but you dont need to start hating the others
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the more features it has  the less useful it will be  the phone has become a baggage that complicates peoples lives  its a disease really 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the war since 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive had both  and i definitely prefer my android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,but the galaxy a g which im buying is getting  years of updates
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i noticed something he kinda pointed out and it’s that’s apple gets updates longer and how iphone xr or whatever is also geting ios  but he didn’t fully explain that’s only software updates and that even older iphones still get security updates meaning they are still safe so even tho the  phones is most likely slow and outdated you don’t really have to stress out about security
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,eres un crack
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im a google pixel user who has a sealed iphone in the desk  i will never trade my ability for some stuff versus convenience  about apps  android is a winner  because i can download any app besides a store which saves me money and gives me more options 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,fantastic review  thank you so much  im an android user i am sending this review to my iphone obsessed brother tonight  and you are right it is an eden of possibilities
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,is crazy that you didnt mention pricing value  heres android clear winner  like u can get cheap android  there are very wide range of prices  with apple its all  premium  devices  for very premium prices
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ecosystem  applee  any day of the week  android havent even come close to it and will never get close to it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,now i know why i was never pulled towards android  bid factor for me is ease of use and a super low factor is customisation even though i do like a good design  it just doesnt have to be unique  couldnt care less hahah ^^ all the other factors are either not relevant or not that relevant to me  one other thing that would be big for me is price  but since i got my iphones second hand and im not too big on the newest features and best quality in everything im happy with a cheap old iphone ^^
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,man i been watching this channel for years now and just realized i wasn’t subscribed until marques just said to and i checked  lol  one of the best channels on youtube 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,walkie talkie better
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i was sad to switch to the iphone because i felt like i lost a lot of features from android  ive had an iphone for  years  and i am returning to android  samsung galaxy s ultra for the w 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’ve used android for so many years the problem with android it will freeze up and update and want to delete my apps   so i got tired of using my google one plus nord n
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,about the apps according to me android should be the winner as android gives you the flexibility  you can get many great open source softwares on android  also even for a very small work an app can do ios developers charge a lot whereas in android these features are either available natively or you can get free apps 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so what everyone failed to see was marques knew google was about to flip the script with updates   now with  years of support updats that now puts andriod at  and apple at  lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i cant lie android really proved itself this time and many times before  with the revolutionary touchscreen pen  incredible camera zoom technology and lets not forget the new flexible displays  like the awesome samsung z flip and z fold

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,very good comparison of apple and android and i like how you presented the pros and cons of each  but the one thing that gets under my skin is how iphones are made around fashion and style  if i only had a nickel for every time apple said beautiful and gorgeous in a keynote 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is a next generation nokia replacement for simple minds

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i had an iphone  and   then switched to android  i stayed on android from probably  until   a solid  years  and i would switch phones often  i had them all  blu samsung motorola unihertz i had the flips  everything  i would change probably once every  months  i switched back to iphone in  just to see  i am on my second iphone since  i have a solid perspective on whats better on both  bottom line  imessage is the sole reason to stay on apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is  ease of use  really  lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as someone who has used both over the years  from a purely user experience perspective  apple is so far ahead of google  especially with the apple written apps  ibooks  imovie  pages  numbers  etc  compare them against their google counterpart and theres no competition  even the integration of apple watch is just too well executed  android isnt bad  but apple is just more polished  its a lexus vs a toyota  additionally  depending on who makes the android phone  the experience will be different  pixel vs samsung  samsung puts so much crap on the phone  i e  shitty bixby force bounded to a button which i think they finally made something you can disable 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,cringe video by the most overrated tech reviewer out
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would have got an andriod if i didnt love my ipad and macbook so much  i only care about ecosystem features on the iphone at this point  androids are great  but their ecosystem is still not as great  or as easy to use  as apples  i want tech to just work for me instead of having to dig into the settings and waste time trying our gimmicky features  the iphone  pro max has a x zoom and usb c but still no fast charging  i will still keep my iphone  though  still loved it and the green color 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,weak  make a decision once in a while  excite your viewers…
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i had samsung note for  years and worked fine  when it was time to retire it  i opted to try iphone  and sad to say after  year and  months  my iphone s battery became worse and started to lag with minimal use or the same level of usage as i had used my samsung note  in conclusion  bang for the buck note  my most amazing phone ever  but for looks  handiness and great ecosystem with my other apple products  apple wins the case  but morally  they should be able to create iphones that are worthy of their price not some high priced but china level of quality  dude  that is day time robbery  have some conscience 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i swear i haven’t heard the word  rubric  since high school lmaoo
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think usb c should be also considered in the  ease of use  since you dont have to bring different types of cables to charge your devices

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,never gotten along with apple anything

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i switch from iphone to android couple months ago and ive been iphone for  years  in my opinion iphone is more user friendly  but android can do x more  i dont think ill ever go back tbh
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,theres something about those green text messages that just a big turn off for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ugh

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,being in india  i  invested  a relatively huge amount in an iphone about  months ago  i don’t consider myself a power user  but man ios sucks  it’s at least half a decade behind of android on basic features  i wish i would have bought a pixel and invested the surplus amount 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,havent had an iphone since the s and when i have to use my gfs iphone   i have no idea how to do basic features  the new gestures they added make me want to just turn the damn things off  i used to always agree apple had ease of use down  but since they took away the physical home button  i no longer agree  lg and google have incredibly simple and intuitive operating systems 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,just switched to android recently  couldnt stand iphone trying to make everything exclusive 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,id argue that the apps point shouldve been androids  i mean  yeah the google play store is great  but also think about all the other downloadable apks 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think it should have been a        draw  im a pixel fanboy and agree with everything that he says here with the exception of the app landscape  i think thats a wash 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, pro  best phone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,these videos are pointless as its entirely relative to the individual consumer 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,honestly i have the same set up  folding android and an iphone for other stuff apple does better ha 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i was an iphone user since   but just out of curiosity in  i got an galaxy s been happy with samsung since  s  s  a  s and now s  ive always been open to go back to an iphone but a new galaxy has always been more exciting  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in another words apple is a dinosaur thats loved by old people  android is the future 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the apps matter most the main popular ones i use i want it to be the best experience  ios  that’s all i use my phone for  otherwise peer pressure keeping in imessage facetime is my second important factor 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,cool
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,whats the best phone for productivity such as to do list  managing tasks and calendars

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android all day long 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the way you approached this comparison highlights your understand of how people interact with technology  you are very objective in a subjective manner 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the short answer is  if you are a boring person  you will buy an iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,something marques missed or forgot to mention with samsung ecosystem is that i can simply cast from my phone to my samsung smarttv 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i need apple and samsung to send me a free phone to judge each one  im waiting 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,do you feel like you are being influenced by corporations to get people addicted to their products and consumerism in general 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,google is now offering  years of software updates 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,but  are you perhaps concentrating more on the usa  rather than the uk  where i live  im sure that ios  isnt as popular in england as the states  please correct me if im wrong 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,possibly  the main reason for not getting an iphone  its stupid extra large camera notch  are they now the only company who persists with this feature  abomination 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"as an iphone fanboy  i am offended  frustrated  insulted  violated  harassed  assaulted  angry  raped  hyperventilating and rage crying because other android companies have managed to be good in more than just a few categories  the iphone must not be surpassed in some categories  i really like the now slightly faster charging  photography  screen resolution  better durability  more features  longer battery and i think even longer than the rog  ultimate which was said to be the longest  and also the  fps which throttles down to + fps genshin impact gaming after   hours or so with the iphone which is the game i play the most during my days off   i hope android does those things i mentioned especially the gaming part because throttling is a pain  never tried the latest android flagships before but im sure iphone does literally everything better  im sure the s ultra  when it comes out  wont even be close to the iphone  pro max  i feel this is true  even my high school girl friends say so   also  i feel like its not true that the iphone is being overhyped  the apple world is full of honest people  i mean the apple company even excluded chargers to save the planet  some experts say it actually harms the planet more because ordering a charger online will consume another box and sometimes the box is even bigger for delivery  and also the fuel needed and other miscellaneous resources for logistics  but i personally believe in apples integrity and concern for the planet  i can just strongly feel it "
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,google just passed apple in guaranteed updates   years 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my mom uses an android phone  on her phone  there are  phone app icons in different places    point for android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps category focuses entirely on social productivity apps and completely ignores the gaming half of what the apps category should encompass   remember that the vast majority of gamers are mobile gamers  so ignoring that entire section is pretty bad  and with that in mind  android wins hands down   its not even close  im an iphone user  originally bought it for battery life  but now i have an apple card so im kinda stuck until i can afford to have a second phone  and the swath of missing games in the app store is appalling   the biggest category of missing titles is rpgs  idk why but the rpg category on ios is basically empty  apple has always been strongly anti gamer  even now as they pretend to give a shit they release features that are expressly anti gamer  so its not surprising that a lot of games are missing but come on man   as i was writing this i actually came up with  more things that push the apps category into androids favor    first  ads  ads on ios are fucking awful  the lack of back button means the ads are entirely unskippable and on top of that they allow the ad developers to create ads that dont have a close button  so not only can you not close the ad once it starts  you cant close the ad once it finishes either  you have to completely close the app and open it again  thats fucking awful   second  apples decisions regarding content control  apple hates its users and it especially hates users that want to use the content that they own  sideloading apps is intentionally made to be as difficult as possible  not because they want you to use  safe  apps  but because they want you to use apps they can control and profit from  plain and simple  theyre greedy  nowhere is this more clear than with their stance on emulators  they openly do not allow emulators on the app store even though they break no laws in any countries that matter  sorry north korea  but you suck ass    so basically  apps category should go to android  while i agree that there is a small subsection of apps that are objectively better on ios    its a very small subsection    the apps arent better enough to completely ignore every other subsection of apps that exist   im not saying marques is an apple shill or anything  more like  he just didnt think about people that use phones differently than he does  basically hes an elite culture snob out of touch with the common man  but thats kindof a given when youve been successful and had open access to so much tech for so long 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,gay nugget
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,noice green screen
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would love to switch to android but they dont make small phones  of course apple stopped too  now that i could need one  looks i have to use my good old iphone xs until it finally gives up but its just sad   ps 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is just bad
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,listening at   on   speed and its crackingg me up
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,yeah but i dont need youtube premium when i have an android so 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,google pixel is the best phone  i don’t understand how people can argue
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,we are 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i highly disagree on the apps cause in africa some countries cant even access the youtube app on the appstore i mean you cant download it on the app store which is very crazy so the w has to go  the android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what is the intro song playing in the beginning of the video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i was considering getting back to android after using iphone for  years  but then i realized i’m too far into the apple ecosystem  i have airpods  ipad pro  apple watch  and going into android would make them unpractical  guess i’m stuck here for a while lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think android should have won out on the ecosystem being how much more open it is   those apple walls are a double edge sword   i definitely find it an issue with work which uses windows pcs   the android ecosystem just meshes well with anything and is much more flexible 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,id like to say  on the basis of updates  when you say  samsung announced in  that all devices in  or later will get four years of security updates and some flagships will even get five  for anyone thinking about buying an iphone or an android correct me if im wrong  will probably be comparing the latest or second latest iphone to the latest or second latest  android and if its samsung youll probably be thinking of the latest flagship  so to sum it all up  if your comparing the two then samsung and apple will be tied  and far above that google announced  years  and though its probably good to mention their bad reputation when it comes to these things   so i would say if you  like a lot of people are considering a samsung  they will probably be tied thus tying the score between iphone and android i know kind of a bummer  and if your considering a google than android actually beats apple by a large margin making it win in the points even though like marques said  its about your personal necessities in a phone   feel free to give your take in the comments  but please keep it civil unless i really messed up then i guess just lay it on me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about battery life  resistance strength  charge time  and cost 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,all new iphones in  can use usb type c charging so your facts homie before talking shit
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in full honesty apple is not the same after steve jobs passed away rip  samsung is more innovative and have overall a better ecosystem by now  and lets not even bring up the cameras  samsung have leaped away from apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,totally agree 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im flipping to both sides  my android is in the mail 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,surprised that security was not a category  thanks
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,instead of making the conclusion  he confused all in the end  anyway  as per my experience on this channel  he always praises apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me  android automatically wins the app category because you can run game emulators  which you cant do on an iphone for some reason 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great content what’s your daily drivers now 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in india i phone is always about financial status 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the iphone  and  is the same android upgrades more thats why i have android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,whoah beby android won
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i watched this video again today   realize there is one more reason for me to switch toi android when i have the budget  that is the keyboard typing  here in philippines there is no tagalog version for speak to type or keyboard gesture to type in any gadgets editing   typing on an iphone is a disaster  android is very smooth   easy when it comes to typing   editing mistyped words 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i agree or understand almost all your point except for the apps  there are so many apps for android that are not on the play store and thus not available at all on ios  i cannot inject payloads on my switch  pen test networks or get custom hacked versions of apps on ios and there are so many custom apps on android that i think there is no comparison 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone has a better support theyre expensive than android but they do last better it is true apple is coping everything from android each time more but samsung is getting real good with the support thing anyways iphone still having more support but also being expensier
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im using both phone and they are work together  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you cant download media  torrenting   revanced patches  than you dont own your phone and with eyephone you cant do that
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its just simple  android is better for the majority of phone users because of the huge hardware choice in every budget segment 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a lot of people have iphone and it makes me want to have one but i am just so used to split screen  pop up window  easily connecting my phone to my pc and move stuff around list can go on for a bit but yeah those features i cant let em go
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as i have always said you buy an iphone for your mom and an android for yourself 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it’s also hard to compare apple and android purely because there is so much variety with android with  different phones with different options compared to  iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,today only i realized i have not been suscribed to this channel  lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i find android is good if the expensive you buy and iphone is good the recent model you buy
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps for ios  what  on android you can literally download and install any apk  only this can justify buying android for many people 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no matter customization  díme lo mejor 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,add played before the video started saying  sponsored by apple  and an iphone  trailer played so i knew the winner without watching 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im with android b c i have a custom built pc   im not a  power user  or use my phone on daily   i watch youtube and transfer porn from my pc to my phone to watch while its arm day   dont pretend like you dont do it too 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple phones feel expensive and solid  when i had the ultra it felt cheap in the hand even though its not  not to mention the phones look ugly  sometimes i think to get one of the folding phones though  the new oneplus open looks sick   there is also this really weird feel apps have on android that i can’t quite put into words  its probably due to the way devs have to develop for only a small few phones on ios whereas android apps have to work with the hundreds of android phones   i think whats most important to me is not how many features and customizable a phone is but rather how everything is packaged together  i have never been in a situation where i said  man i wish i had an android to have x feature  but when i had the ultra i kept thinking  i dont have facetime  airdrop  etc  everything just feels so fluid and nice with ios  everything just fits right 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,using an iphone for the first time in my cell phone career life  and i see lots of good design and ux  from a longtime android user  mostly samsung  it felt like i had to learn a different language the first day of use  a lot of common tasks werent present  or they just didnt work as well   one of them being the keyboard  typing on the iphone right now  and its just a bad  gross experience compared to the android phones ive used  and the lack of being able to customize is frustrating  however  i do understand why some people like the prettiness of the iphone and its interactions and transitions between apps  but am missing the highly customized experience you can get from an android system  oh and a calculator with history  and samsungs sideswipe edge panel  so useful 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,concerning security issues  the iphone is far superior to android  its safer  harder to break its system and offers much more protection and privacy   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for every quality app on google play store theres at least   crap apps 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i recently switched to an iphone from android and the lack of customisation is really grinding my gear  wann remove that stupid white bar on the bottom  nope  not possible  want to unlock your phone without swiping up the screen  nope  not the apple way  why apple whyyyyyyyyyy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use only comes into play for the iphone once you have learned and memorized the navigation for most apps that you use  even after having ios devices  iphone and ipad pro  for many years now  i still get confused how to go back a step in various apps  how to close menus or select options  and these navigation gestures sometimes even change depending on which device and what ios version i’m using  in android i always have my trusty back button or consistent back gesture  in ios those things change for every single app  sometimes you have to swipe down  sometimes it’s pinching  sometimes it’s swiping left or right  it really gets confusing  especially on ios  many apps try to follow their design standards of minimalistic menus  so i often have to look up how to do things as buttons or navigation is not labeled   think about how many different options you need to learn to use procreate  it’s honestly genius that they offer apple support in all of their readily available stores  but i can’t help but think that it’s far more required for the devices due to the minimalistic approach of menus end navigation  add a big shout out to apple for their many years of software support  my work phone is a super old iphone +  which has been running and been supported with updates since already almost  years  for anything security related  apple has a clear advantage and is leading the way in my opinion 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,where is the  hardware  category man  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for the easy of use and security  i stay with the iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how about how smooth system works  apple lately not doing their job up to their own standards
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you are an american  buy an iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple the american company  still made in communist china 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i really hate the way the apple ecosystem works and its limitations   that is the main reason i am android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,on the  apps  category  if you took into consideration apk and developper mode for android than that wouldve flipped the conclusion and an easy win for android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,app dev here  the only reason apple apps come before android is because of apples pia review process that can take between  hour to a few weeks  and youll never know which one it is  google play review is fast and easy  so apple first to get the stupid review process done then you roll out android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,edit now google is doin  years  the update comment  section didnt age well after the pixel  came out 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,complaining about customizing but at face_with_tears_of_joy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,complaining about customizing but at face_with_tears_of_joy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,he said on the podcast he’s an android guy  i find this video biased
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is still my winner   do i have an iphone yes   was it my choice no   when i have a choice will i switch yes
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dex killed the ipad just putting it out there 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is winner inmost important things for many users which are  battery screen camera
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,honestly i believe in the app category android has it because of the ability to download mod apps
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i switched from android to ios so far it is great but little things like awful calculator  no call recording  etc  makes me want to switch back
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love this and your observations  android till death  i know it may be taboo to talk about apple culture  mums the word  apple=child safe 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,honestly apple is a joke  they hold their customers prisoner  theyre far behind and innovation constantly late to the party  totally  overrated overhyped never been the best at anything and theyre inability to work with  the rest of the world shows what a scared  insecure little company they are  not to mention theyre a terrible company in general
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if google had thier version of airdrop and not this wierd  nearby share  feature and something in the range of imessage where its first party  you can talk to essentially all google if not all android users for free and you dont have to go through rd party apps  because there is so many and everybody uses something different  i think it would be over  i think google is probably the closest in that aspect as they have google pay  pixel watch  pixel phone  nest  etc  i believe they are right there and probably have advantage if they could just focus on one thing at a time    imagine if you could have chrome or a chrome widget on you computer that you can get phone notifications and send recieve items to and from your phone and computer  everyone uses google docs or sheets now  their ui is prettly sleek  idk i think google can be the apple killer if they play their cards right 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,id say the ecosystem category is a tie  i can see the merit of the apple ecosystem having had some experience with it being so seamless  but the google ecosystem is also very powerful  for example being able to purchase a movie on youtube and accessing that on any device that can play youtube is amazing  not every device has itunes so that integration is limited  google services being so universal is a big pro along with the seamlessness of apples ecosystem 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,whats your opinion on camera quality 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i swear iphone users say facetime is so perfect and no other way of video calling exists  i honestly use facebook and snapchat to message more then actually message which both can video chat with 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my beef with iphone is the same as with modern cars  if you are not really looking  you wont be able to tell which one it is particularly from the back  that is the primary reason i didnt fo for iphone  they all look the same 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my dude is an iphone fanboy   like how tf iphone won in app part   android can get tons of apk stuff
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,most important feature is the price of the phones which should be talked about 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i am not the worlds biggest fan of apple or google  but im gonna side with android  days a week  the software is better  more versatile  and allows you to pick which manufacturer you actually want to buy a phone from   you can buy a cheaper phone for about   that meets your needs  or an over   phone with the most advanced chipset  you can always go somewhere in the middle of that as well  apple does not have this flexibility  or at least not anymore tbh   also apple is only embracing usb c now  and only because the eu is forcing them  seriously  it only took them  or  years longer than everyone else to get on board  hooray 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,he forgot to mention who has a better screen which is a huge thing in a smartphone   overall camera experience  quality from high end android phones  which kill apple  or how about  + watt charging   battery life 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is not a phone  fix your title lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love pixels but until they get the battery to last as long as an iphone i can’t switch back  i need a long battery life which my  pro max definitely has
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a fun follow up to this video would be … switching from apple to android  or vice versa 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as a day  android user who is constantly harassed about my green texts  i really like this video  you cant argue with it but it still comes down to personal preference  id really like to try an iphone but i enjoy my samsungs too much 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps shouldnt go to the iphone  youve got ton more apps for android  official ones and unnoficial ones  time and time again i see someone fancing a  different  version of youtube or an app to watch online tv not available for iphone for censorship reasons 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, aju meosjin 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i go still buy iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think the most important point is missing  privacy  i think my data is better protected in an iphone ecosystem than in an android ecosystem 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,holy hell your videos look amazing on p wish that i had unlimited data all the time
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,funny how youtube app on iphone is much better than android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the most objective and well done comparison between the two that ive every witnessed  well done 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i disagree with the apps section  downloading random sh t from the internet is way easier on android  and optimization is pretty much meaningless if the phone can handle it just fine 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i use a lot of google apps google calendar  google clock  etc  and i also use outlook for emails  are these apps available on the iphone  thanks for any help 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i hope your knee feels beter
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,is that a pixel foldable 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i use an android phone because there is a phone for every budget 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thanks for this   kind of like mac   pc debate  decades ago 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use  performance and reliability is my main buying point    which are clearly what iphone have 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one parameter that can play a role is   the price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,do you mean ios   because iphone is the device  android is the os  and now xiaomi and huawei just left the android  the question is how long  android  will still exist   apple just smiling know this fact
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what a waste of time  do u really think that anyone invested it their own system will change because of your biases 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,never once have i thought android was too complicated  more options is just better   iphone is like a childs toy  like a games console  very confined limited but optimized   and android is like a pc in comparison  with more options and freedom 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,usb c aged well
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have to strongly disagree about the apps  while apple does get updates quickly they are also stuck behind the app store wall  third party app downloading is not a thing  this means that your accessibility to apps is censored on a corporate or governmental level  the ability to download apks for android is a hugely important feature for those that need or use it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,not even close   you can get a   year old android phone for half price   problem solved 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have been an iphone user ever since iphone  was released  i understand the fact iphone has always had the same feature like forever and added few tweaks to the new iso updates  however i like the fact iphone is easy to use and easier to get around  i have an old samsung tablet  i find getting round the apps and finding what you are looking for is little confusing and complicated  whereas an iphone  in my opinion is straight forward  of course using the same type of phone  you’ll get use to it the more you use it  i just like how iphone is just simple and sleek 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this made me reconsider everything  i thank you so much 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its not impossible im holding a samsung galaxy a and a brand new iphone   forget the camera  battery  sound quality  nice perks  but the functionality of the phone is what actually matters  it literally takes me more steps to do the exact same things on the   im going to keep using it until the next samsung comes out and trade it in   this is not debatable  at all and the people who are debating it are simping for the status   edit  ease of use is basically what i was talking about and that only applies for people who have had iphones before  new users to phones will have a better time with droid   i also couldnt give less of a sh t about updates
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this video was suggested to me after watching the collab you did last year with mrwhosetheboss on this same topic  interesting to see how things have progressed since then 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,funny how i saw this coming  apps and accesories are easily android win  but you had to give win to apple so they get to win as a whole 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,skull 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, the winner is us  i dont think so  there are many desitions that they copy eachother that are harmful to us  like not selling phones with chargers and without headphone jack
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,only thing in my opinion you missed is the customer support thing  it really depends where you live there is a lot of countries that do not even have apple stores  where if you have an android there is representation literally everywhere globally  otherwise amazing video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive always said  if you have a mac or use facetime  iphone is the only way to go  if neither of those are true  i dont see any advantage of an iphone over android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,micro sd card support can only be had on android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use should be equal bro  android lovers will love android and iphone lovers will love iphone  both are ease to use and determined by the preference of choice 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for the algo
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,let me say one thing wahtever the result is from any reviwer it os always biased   specially for iphone     you may think yes based on the categories mentioned its correct      customizations   features   updates and support   apps  ecosystem    but in the first place this is not the only review categories or the biggest   there are more important  stuffs   like installing amy app i wamt from waherever i get    dont control me dont tell me i cant install that app because its from an unkown source   shut the fk up and install it you are not my parent    and i dont give a f about eco system   i like the freedom of android   i get any headphone   earbud   smart watch   anything  will work   fine with my android device     also usb debugging  mode   and developper mode     android device is something you own and you are free to use as you want     iphone is something that controls you to use it as they want  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i use an ipad    use a pixel  best of both worlds 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i mean the most important category is price  what if i say i want a   phone for my daily use   is this society gonna reject me  lol  android is definitely the best option as it caters to people dealing with any budget range   and its not even a lack of money or anything  i just deem it impractical to spend more than   on a phone  go figure  give me an iphone that cheap android all the way  and then  spend money in other more meaningful stuff 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the biggest winner is  us  they made me broke dude … kidding… 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android kills iphone when it comes to excitement
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,redo this now with the iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its funny i changed to an iphone from android and i never could learn apple ios  i told a coworker ot was to hard to use and i liked andriod better  his reply to me was crazy he said iphone was for dummies morw or less  he said android was more comlex which i thought was funny  i guess we all get use to one or the other 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its really difficult to compare android vs iphone  android can be delivered over the network  iphone needs physical delivery  iphone have a better camera as android doesnt have any  it only contain the apps to control it  android can be modified a lot  iphone will always be the same  only ios can change  but the main difference is the price  iphone is quite costly  while android is usually included with the phone for free 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, because apple store are everywhere  ummm  maybe in the us  geographical bias 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,side loading apps on android and the amount of apps  apple having a monopoly over there store  android clearly wins apps
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its funny you compare  iphone  with all andorid type  the title must be  iphone with samsung  or some brand  not all androids  its like you compare  bmw  with all japanese car 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the real winner is the friendships we made along the way
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i found potatoes to be better than android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,oh man  regarding moving icons  pixel  pro  android   they switched places picture preview and camera rotation  front   back camera  horrible
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, nicely done   thank you  wish id watched this a couple of weeks ago  ~ kevin mccarthy
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,main a iphone and i still think android is better  i think technical people enjoy android more than iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you missed what for me is one of the most important categories  expandability  the fact that i have the choice to pop in a    gb sd card in my phone is big 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i used to only have iphones until gen   when  came out  apple slowed my phone to a crawl so i switched to a pretty alright galaxy phone  it was like the wild west  i missed my safe cookie cutter iphone  eventually i got used to the amazing customization features on android and i can never go back 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont agree with that app  most crypto traders struggle with iphone cuz most of the needed apps arent accessible on ios and ive heard programmers and developers complain too
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ok so nothing phone orrrr google pixel  pro
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hey  just hope you will see it   what happens to your left hand at   in the video  is this like photoshopped over a mac screen 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,maybe the real winner was the friends we made along the way
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,multitasking is the biggest win for android  its unbelievable to me you still cant spilt screen or pop up window a second app  i use this everyday  gps with youtube or netflix window on long drives  split screen calculator and notepad so i can use the calculator while looking at me figures this is literally the only reason i dont even consider an iphone  android has had this for what seems forever now 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,that was the best video i have ever watched in my life
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think ease of use and ecosystem categories are overlapping
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is good but it is not for it guys for sure 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is good but it is not for it guys for sure 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,puts vs in title  theres no objective winner  everyone gets a participation award and i wasted well who am i kidding i didnt watch the video i fast forward it because its always the same  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone doesnt have any emulator app for ds  switch  and ps  so its an instant deal breaker for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i wouldnt even call it a slight advantage with the apps 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great i phone is winner i will go and buy one… wait i am forgetting i can’t afford it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,and now with the pixel  the win for the updates support category goes clearly to android  especially when samsung and other huge android brands will follow 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,andriod looks very cheap
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ecosystem with the airtag tracking is so important for me and my son with adhd constantly losing things we now can’t go without iphone  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple apps are tedious and expensive af  for example is the messenger app it doesnt have a chat heads
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,with pixel  and fairphone  support seems to be on par or better than with iphone  i think its great that phones can be used for a much longer time now 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its not  iphone vs android    its should be ios vs android or iphone or galaxy iphine or pixel etc
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when someone comes up with a lefthanded mode where send buttons and what not are on the left instead of right  theyll be a clear winner for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is all about makeing money regardless what custumors want 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in that way lousy  limits your freedom of expression in this specific context  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple needs to cut the shit and add file management easy to download apps from sources other than the app store  id make the switch pretty quickly they just added that
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,team android like a small computer  easy to run my business from my phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot variety of devices and charging speeds
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,have  of each
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i disagree with the ease of use  if i gave an iphone and android to my grandparents  they would have a much harder time navigating an iphone  android adjusting features in its ui has actually improved ease of use because it has allowed android to figure out what works best for its users 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,missing so much there  like ecosystem  you can connect to pc and other hardware on android just via usb  gl trying that on iphones ports are closed  you need itunes and its like a virus completely pita 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so apple wins if you are speaking to a tech illiterate and android wins if you are literate 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung xcover  pro or sonimxp  for heavy construction  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well update support is now a point for android because google gave the pixels  years of os updates 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i loved my iphone and i reallllly loved my apple watch   but i switched to pixel  and pixel watch last spring   the pixel is just so much smarter and apple   assistant is actually useful unlike siri  call screening is insanely nice  charging is faster  camera is leagues ahead  it can do whatever i want  and its easy to use   only things i really miss are the timed notification grouping on ios and the large screen on my apple watch   love them both  but im sticking with pixel for a while 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love apples
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is not better than android  not even close  marques just loves apple  the steve jobs effect 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,both android and ios iphone that’s the way i roll i just simply love smartphones i have two samsung’s and my iphone  plus my first ever it’s been a new experience  thanks for the review i always enjoy
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hey  android does have focus mode 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so being in the us is the sole reason to give the nod to the iphone for having the better ecosystem absolute nonsense
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,j  cole stan i see 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dual messenger  hellooooo  iwhat 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,please consider apple’s horrendous file management  it should have been another category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android all the way apple is so basic
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no shit its android  for me iphone only wins in once aspect  for now  its that they can record in log  which im sure eventually an android phone will be able to do 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,winner at  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,oddly enough  both are missing the headphone jack and expandable storage  aside from the sony xperia 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is for well off people and majority of the world is not
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,re apps analysis   doesnt mention android apks 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,watch from pakistan  dude
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,is the iphone  still a good phone  getting one for christmas 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,best info  but to nice  corporate tip toe but what if they get mad       so  what 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use is relevant in year  not   nowadays that ease of use for ios is akin to a kid mode lol  if you dont know how to navigate a phones ui at this point  ios has no benefit over android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,youre legit  great review  love the ending  in the end  the phone is an extension of you  pick the one that fits you  neither is inherently better 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video  i have one major disagreement though  apps  the view about focusing on ios is correct  but the idea that only some small niche apps are the difference is wrong  there are entire categories of apps missing on ios  for example  emulators  this is not some small thing  ppsspp on android has over  million downloads  others have millions or tens of millions  the entire world of emulation gaming only exists on android  there are no emulators in the app store  and jailbreaking isnt going to get you the same either plus youre already out of the ecosystem at that point    another category missing is desktop usage  samsung dex is one of the examples  but not the only one  you can run full blown linux systems on your phone  connect it to a big screen  and have an actual desktop user experience  andronix alone has over a million downloads  so its a decent size audience  the whole idea of turning your phone into a desktop doesnt exist in ios   one more  custom launchers  nova and microsoft launchers have + million downloads each  there are multiple launchers with  again  millions and tens of millions of downloads each  adding them all together there are hundreds of millions of people using custom launcher apps  and the entire category of custom launchers is missing in ios    then on top of that you start getting into specialty apps  say you want a terminal on your phone  you can install termux on android  and execute stuff on the go if needed  theres no equivalent in ios  termux has over a million downloads too  so not too shabby  granted  this isnt for the general public  but it has to be acknowledged that android offers something for a lot of niches  while ios only targets the general  to put it that way  basically the bottom line is pretty much any app made for ios can be made for android too  but the reverse isnt true  this should give the edge back to android in my opinion  yes  your instagram updates will come to ios first  but when you have whole categories  with tens or even hundreds of millions of combined downloads on android  missing in the app store  i dont see how that point can be given to ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why compare a hardware product to an operating system 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its just   a fact   apple  is shitt  and android has so much more  in every aspect 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im an android user since  and ive always used a lot of widgets   but i also have an ipad and i still havent figured out how to use ios widgets conveniently
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,have used both  restvalue of an iphone is much higher and os is more stable   android phones are great if it uses bare android  because otherwise they get slow real fast  looking at you samsung  android os is more flexible for customizing  but less  safe  from outside interference    there is no good or bad  there is choice 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i was hoping the subjectivity system at the end was going to be linear algebra   this is called a dot product 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android dont need all the extra upgrades like apple cause theyre already ahead
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me expandable memory is a big factor  so the iphone has already lost
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you can do so much more on android tbh 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,earned a subscriber  great video  very level headed and informative assessment  thank you 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,windows 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,beats around the bush and no defined winner   sounds right    android   the winner is android on a samsung phone  typing from an iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you are a smart guy marques  very well put together and a nice conclusion 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i vastly prefer iphone  i have since the iphone  way back  i now have a  mini  i don’t care about ultra customization and i value apple’s take on privacy  iphones are way better looking too 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,pretty simple  all iphones are excellent  not all android phones are  in fact    of them are pure garbage and make the os useless 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it comes down to messaging   android can only send   photos at a time or days too much   android videos are pixelated when sending   that’s the main problem
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,got both  samsung s for private nd iphone  pro for work   i love the design of the iphone  it’s just appealing to me  no android on this world can give me the same  wowwww  feeling what apple does   that being said…    i hate that you don’t have digitssss           so annoying   why cant you pause during video recording  i don’t want to use rd party apps to do this   why cant we put the app icons wherever we want in our screen without other icons filling up the gaps  with android you can put them in a way that you can see your background picture better instead of all the app icons blocking your family picture   calculator 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hey man  tweetbot no longer works how you got it on your iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use  concludes that iphone is a grandma grandpa phone  its for old people who dont understand complicated features  just want to call or video chat and thats about it  they dont care for any special features  they dont want things changed and it confuses them if the do change a little bit  they like things a certain way 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,now that google offers  years of updates support  does that make it android   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so people in the us really care that much about imessage and facetime 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the day google launch a pixel with the front camera iphones have  i will change asap  thats the main reason i still use iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone has always been a status symbol thus apple gets to do whatever it wants   as in give us the same exact shit phone year after year    android has always delivered to the public the tech we want and need on the phones  far more superior  i would never go back to iphone  you coulndt pay me to carry that brick around 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android phones support ldac and aptx  hd
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wish they would just let us all face time ea other
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,scam
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple thinks different when it comes to practical user experience design  the way they think different is that if theres something thats universally  objectively beneficial to the user but that feature is on other platforms   then apple users will be denied that feature so that apple can be different  perfect example of this is the absence of the option to have  button navigation in ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so the apple is for dummies  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well   you mentioned in the video   quality of apps  quality over quantity goes to apple   support of os across generations of devices goes to apple   ease of use goes to apple   quality of ecosystem and consistency you mentioned apple don’t change unless there is a reason    isn’t this a video that squeeze in the fact that apple is just better  if better correlated to quality  while on the peripherals somehow managed to satisfy android fans by saying androids excitement bits are cool and gonna give that to android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,yeah but phones like samsung got easy mood that you can switch your whole ui to its called easy mode in the settings i know this from one month ago but pixel  have  years now of software updates which is insane and im pretty sure samsung is going to follow with the extra two more years and some of the major apps now like instagram on samsung devices are made for samsung devices for the flagship ones thats 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,on the update and support category  i will give it to android  everytime a new iphone comes out the old iphone become slower 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ecosystem might be a big factor in choosing a phone in the usa  but in many other parts of the world it isnt  many of my friends use an iphone but will never buy an apple computer  they all prefer intel or amd pc so the ecosystem isnt part of their consideration in choosing a phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i really like this review  it is no biased and truely honest  as an android user myself  i will never say the iphone releases are exciting for now and also iphones are never easy to use for me  androids have way better shortcuts and options  but i will say iphone optimizes the apps better than android and ecosystem connections or continuity is a little more seamless than android or pc world  and i really dont get the idea of dynamic island  a little floating window is all we need 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as much as i’m into tech and customization  now being in my ’s  i cannot be bothered with sitting down and spending a bunch of time customizing my phone  i used to spend hours back in the day customizing my htc or my razor  but i just don’t have patience for that shit anymore  i still have very basic widgets on my iphone  i also found that i no longer like custom icons because many times they become hard to identify  so this aspect of android doesn’t move me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,brilliant analysis   love it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,good review
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great review  interestingly its the ecosystem  which is undoubtedly better on the apple  which puts me off apple  i like the huge selection you get in the mess that is android and i dont like being semi pushed feeling trapped into everything apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i did my math and it turns out the iphone is x better than android for how i rate it  just make it easy to use and have good apps and i could give a shit about customization 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ill make it easier shorter    you want security updates  iphone   you crave for belonging and tend to evade responsibilities  iphone   else  android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,another good one buddy
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thanks for confirming its android  finally iphoners can realise that their walled garden is quite the limitation in the big ol world 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how can you forget the split screen feature of android which is still missing from iphone  it’s a highly useful feature that majority of android customers use on everyday basis and is super handy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,good content for everyone  if somebody to  buying the smartphone android or ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well google pixel  gets  years of security and feature updates
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios gives zero freedom for its users  you cant even locate your phone when its lost  they put you in prison for the name of privacy   security where in reality you get spied on  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,came to figure out if i should keep my android but now im searching for that floating plant in the background
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when is dex going to apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it’s because samsung did all of it first lol  apple wants to be that different yet there ways and ideas still suck in my opinion  they may win in sales because hey it’s  everyone’s gotta have the newest iphone  it’s an icon  talk about apple and how they make people’s phones slower because there’s a new phone coming out  they do it every year  apple is basic  basic  android in every way is better in my opinion
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you may not realise but most people will certainly care about ecosystem  at least they will be heavily impacted by it   if you have airpods  macbook  apple tv you will definitely have a better experience using an iphone  what sucks is that apple locks you in their ecosystem because it’s really good that it’s hard to escape or use with other devices that are not apple made  and that feeling of being stuck with them is what sucks for me  apple clearly shows signs of monopolising practices which doesn’t make us the winner because it doesn’t promote competition  so it’s the consumers the ones ultimately impacted
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,yup i go with apple ecosystem because i share photos  apps  and music with my family 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’ve recently bought an iphone for the first time  i gotta say the android back gesture with the thumb is the thing i miss the most about android  notifications icons on the top bar is also something i miss a lot  i was expecting more from ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,customization for me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this presentation was well done  great argument  very objective 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,privacy and security would have been an interesting category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,he doesnt know he is using his own version of the bentham theory  its a theory in sociology  google it  oh wait  google owns android and youtuyoutube
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about cost
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphones and apple products have become the product for not so tech savvy cool kids and old people that needs the it just works phone that apple provides  samsung makes better phones  but thanks to steve jobs and the way he markeded apple products especially in the us  its the coolest most  in  phone you can buy  here i europe most people have android phones  and even more in asia 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is the first video i watch on youtube where they suggested a perfectly synchronized french dub  and with a realistic human voice  i dont know if you had to post the transcript yourself  but wow  what a great feature  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there are more powerful niche apps you can use in android because of  apk sideloading 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,on updates support  apple artificially slows down their older phones so you will have to buy new ones  thats a big negative in my book 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a lot of the same apps cost more on ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you should also consider repairability etc  there android phones wins by a landslide  just from the fact that theyre not owned by apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,excitement category is an oversimplification   mkbhd you unremarkably watered down this one  this category is what has brought to life folding phones  id call this category innovation and or invention  the most daring technologies premiere on android  folding phones for example would still be an impossible thought if we all lived in apples world  android pushes technology forward 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i use iphone because some niche apps  like control for specific hardware  like say stereo or tech stuff often get the ios app much earlier than a android app  and they get it working much better  nowadays i always have a ipad around so that could be used instead  with shared internet from a android phone as long it can do that  but it’s easier to have the app available on the phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use   i semi agree  ios might be easier to get into   but i dont think once you get hang of both its easier  sending images on bulk to anyone on whatsapp is big example   its like  steps on android   on ios its hell  and same goes for transfering files between pc and your phone   android is much better 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you spoke too soon on the the security updates lol  google pixel  pro as you already know as  years of updates
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in my opinion though  the thing about  ease of use  is that i still feel like android can be as easy or as complicated as you want it to be
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,youre mistaken  we have focus modes on samsung  named modes
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,updates now go to android with google offering   years 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love this approach  its universal method that can help to make decisions  thanks for sharing this idea 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,heres a big one for me  itunes  i have a massive music library  no other music player syncs such a large collection to any device better than itunes does with an iphone  nor does any other music app on pc or mac have anything like smart playlists  zune and winamp both have something kind of similar  but nothing remotely as fully featured as smart playlists in itunes 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,have you ever tried to find something with files app on ios  this app can not find file that you have on the screen for example in another file manager like documents but not only  files is opposite to osx finder which finds easyly names of files even inside disk indexed by manager of external drives etc android file manager works similar to finder  backup is easy like a snap and does not matter where i want to store my files  ios is a colorfull toy vs android as real productivity tool  i work on mac with windows also  ipad pro  but the only iphone  s  i owned left unopened and soon became someone toy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the real winner is on your wrist  every single video
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you added a price to specs category things vastly change 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,shouldnt  price be a category in this video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if a rat has one straight way from one hole to other  it will never fail  but  if the rat given many ways from one hole to other  it will fail and pass and fail and pass and eventually will pass  what i am gonna say that apples ease of use is for people who dont like changes 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my one gripe is you sold short the concept of ecosystem in android   its an open ecosystem that allows you to jump from brand to brand and to combine brands between products  like phone  watch  tablet  pc etc  and even services websites  i have a gmail account that follows me everywhere and simplifies my life so much  the idea of being locked in to ios macos will always be the biggest deal breaker for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios still does support only few languages  no  respect to smaller languages  android supports much more languages  did you newer used a phone with  sims  try and use   not just simple calling  try switching between lines  sms one or another etc   how to use secure folder in ios  its not just to secure files  photos etc  its to have second set of apps with different google account  private and bussiness  just great stuff only in android    but still   video deserves like from me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well apple beats in battery life thats a  thick box extra points
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,easy to use    apps               features        updates   customization 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dex is one heavily weighted category of its own for me  not just connecting to a pc  but connecting to any screen or even a projector and using it as a proper full res landscape screen is a gamechanger
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the apple way is really the most pathetic way wrt to features  somethings just dont make a y sense
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lifetime apple user here now pixel  pro and never going back  will be upgrading to pro soon  i pulled the pin on iphones when i heard they assisted the chinese govt in surpressing and isolating their citizens im here to tell apple users that if you have been afraid to leave the os and blue imessages  dont be and get a pixel  the swutch is seamless  if you are sticking with apple simply for blue messages give your head a shake
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my phone has focus mode i dont have an iphone did i misunderstand marques  that im dot not have focus mode but i do have it im confused
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think cost is a major factor  especially outside first world countries 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thank you for your sharing  and what about performance and durability between flagship phones 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if u like communism get iphone  if u like democracy get android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i just got my first iphone  the latest and greatest iphone   i’ve been using android for at least  years   i made the switch because i wanted to try it and give it it’s chance  plus i never liked the phones and the os design in android  and i found the iphones always appealing aesthetically   and so far  i really hate it  some things will need some getting used to i think  i was really annoyed by some apps not having any way of getting backups from android to ios  but the most annoying for me is missing the back gesture from any edge  and the implementation of going back in ios  i need to do lots of gymnastics to get back to the previous screen  and it’s hard on the plus model  each app has different views implementation and uses different ways of going back  like sometimes the gesture from the other edge doesn’t work and you need to press the back button all the way on the top left  sometimes you get no back button nor gesture and you need to do a down gesture  or sometime an x button on the top right  it’s soo confusing…  i find my self taking a lot more time to do anything on the iphone  and even after getting used to this i don’t see it beating the small swipe from the edge your thumb is already sitting on   i’m really considering returning the iphone and getting a pixel  pro for the same price  i really don’t agree with the ease of use verdict  it’s really a lot easier to use an adroid   the only thing i like so far is face id  and the good animations and theme in ios  it’s so slick you don’t need to customize anything  but other than that android beats it in evry category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,can u give me google pixal  pro as a gift
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone  and i didn’t watch the video  thankfully 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its nice of you to think i have more than five close friends
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this was a good way to approach this increasingly silly topic  it seems like the arguing has settled down a little compared to a few years ago  but i just dont get caring about what phones other people use  so i like how you put the viewer in the focus here 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android phone for ease of use  file transfers  fast charging   torrenting  iphone for design and build quality
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,always brilliant in your analysis
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how do you possibly use samsung as the android ecosystem when google pixel tablets home nest thermostat cameras doorbells audio devices wifi mesh networks exist  what  how do you use samsung for that example and not google marques 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i`m not even going to play this video  i`m sure  ties is right 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,camera 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i agree with you  having used both the iphone and the pixel  i am using a pixel  pro  and  pro in several days  because what is important to me is price and integration with the google ecosystem  but its just my choice
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i wish android phone app could allow to dial whatsapp directly and also show missed whatsapp calls and vieber telegram or other messagin apps
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i do wish the damn app devs would give android more love for their apps it pisses me off that they only give a shit about ios and android is the bottom of the barrel os that they dont care about which really annoys me and everyone for some reason thinks apple is domingating the world market which they arent theyre just dominating the american market which annoys me cause android has far better use than iphone does
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,actually usb type c is there with iphone too  and you could also mess with the lockscreen
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios is great for streamlined experiences for a premium price but its very limiting  android gives you choice and great hardware but can be inefficient 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,too bad with each android update  its getting less customization options and dumbed down 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my work phone is an apple and my personal phone is samsung so i feel like i do this comparison everyday    years in and multiple versions later  i feel like i know these phones well  there  are things i like and hate on each phone  for example  i automatically do videos on my samsung s but photos on my iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,real winners are cina´s phones
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"features  excitement  customization  apps  updates  easy of use ecosystem "
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,updates support  should go to andriod  apple literally bricked your phone after a year or so  how can you give that point to apple  and not even talk about it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,sorry  easy to use to iphone  have you tried to plugin yojr iphone to a pc  or create a backup on your pc when there is not enough free space on the disk itunes want to save it to  it is really really easy to use  sure 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so far the only thing i really have a gripe about is ease of use as a category  you dont judge a pair of shoes by your ability to walk  thats just basically like your ability to comprehend menus and knowing what things do  if you just dont know and dont care to know go with apple if you dont mind learning something but with android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive always been an android boy  and not because i wanted to  iphones are just to expensive 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  google has now  years of updates   more than apple   just no  there are way more apps on android and they are as good as on iphone  also the developers  are doing it cause it is easier to get on play store than on app store   what on iphone is exiting   also google  samsung  huawei  xiaomi and every other brand has their own ecosystem that works perfectly fine with their devices
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,id love you to do pixel v  iphone once the pixel  is out   i believe it solves a lot of the issues that youve put apple ahead on 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me  i can’t live without airdrop
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i had  iphones my latest phone was my first samsung  the gb se with a gb micro sd card  it never runs out of storage for thirty dollar and change you just put in a new card  and my phone is set to stop charging at  percent  my battery is still going strong after   years where as my iphones gave me all kings of battery issues after  years  and i did not want an infrared laser shining in my eyes every time i needed to open my phone  which is a lot  so eternally grateful for the fingerprint scanner in the power button  unfortunately apple no longer makes a phone that suits my needs  as always marques brownlee thanks for all the great content 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,considering i use google docs  gmail  drive and calendar for work on chrome — and my other most used apps are youtube  maps  photos and google search — my ecosystem rating is gonna be  points for android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about adding storage card  you add it easily on android and have to buy cloud storage on iphone  also how about adding music to the phone  android wins all the way 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,both collect your data  literally everything  and sell it to the government or corporations    i think in the next year im gonna de google an android phone and use that 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android has more freedom than iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you have only used one how would you know the other one is better or not  been using iphone since i put away that old bag phone that plugged into the cigarette lighter in the car   no issues i just need to call someone not have a miniature computer in my pocket
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,take what your heart feels comfortable with  not what people see in your hand 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bruh  it has full hd screen on it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i agree with you  i use phones iphone and android  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dont get how he has so many subscribers 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my find my fails during my commute from school to work sometimes it says i left my ipad in the middle of the road while i’m driving with it and my phone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this guy is so detailed and dedicated i’m subscribing
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,not included but something that  should  be important to people is security and privacy  i cant stand apple forcing me to do things  the apple way  and so im with android  but apple locking things down does make their system more secure 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,oh he says here  that software upgrades are a priority  on the newest video he did on pixel   years upgrades  hes asking people not to buy the phone for longer upgrades 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think if you compare features between stock android and ios  competition is long shot 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thanks
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,latest update  google now offer  years of updates for its pixel phones  apple is now in second place for this feature 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i find iphone a head in the sand only one way   in terms of doing things  android is the clear winner for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i own both an android phone and an apple iphone and what i can say is i prefer iphones because the way the camera looks is so realistic  also on ios i just think it’s prettier  android is kinda hard for me to use because there is just so much buttons and i type slower there   nothing wrong buying an android or apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,articulate
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps are definitely a victory for android for me  because there are so many apps that i download that are not possible in an  official way  and are part of my daily life  if you konw whero to download  everything is free in android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,google seen this and said  years of updates 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,also this has to be said a pro to the iphone is that people wont bully u for your phone  i think this is stupid 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,summary  iphone for simplefolks  android for power users 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you like iphone    iphone is the winner  you like android    android is the winner  for me android is the winner  foldable phones are the latest big innovation 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,sorry  but for ease of use  the way apple does a lot of icons or moving around the phone  its just not very intuitive  which makes it not an ease of use  so many apps you have to figure out what the icons actually mean  meanwhile for android  it just makes sense  most of the time at least  once in a while they mess it up too  but generally android makes so much more sense with ease of use wise 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nice review brotha    i totally agree   i had an android for many years and switch to ios   in the of the day   its about what works for you  to me its like buying a firearm   you dont rely on other peoples suggestions on what you should get   get a feel to what works to what it feels for your hand and your capabilities   thanks for sharing 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is best 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android for me   i love my freedom too much
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’m not sticking to apple or samsung ecosystem as i’m currently using iphone    samsung galaxy tab s lite  planning to upgrade into iphone  pro   samsung galaxy tab s soon  so i’m getting the best of both world     imo for phone i always prefer iphone over samsung but for tablet i always prefer samsung over ipad 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well for software support  google pixel  takes the cake bc they now have  years of software updates
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is love
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,cool video man
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i moved to ios because work issued iphones  i found that the most popular daily apps just worked better for me on ios  i think this is an overlooked aspect of the software  i do think after  years with ios this may have changed by now 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,omg i better go out and tell everyone to get an iphone because they won and now theyre getting usb 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,grindr extra is waaay cheaper on android  android wins 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,easy of use always android  apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,innovation instead of excitement wouldve been a better category i think
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the main reason i dont even consider apple is the apps the mainstream ones may be better but i mostly download apps that just arent on apple or apple doesnt want on apple even things from github so i just cant agree with apples win for myself but for most people sure
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great job  i really enjoyed this  android wins for me    ive been onboard with pixel since the beginning and nexus before that so no surprise 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,google maybe saw this video and just announced  year support
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my wife has used iphones since iphone   and shes now utterly fed up with all the icloud itunes crap  and the various bugs  like  her  pro max has died on her  and thank god she bought apple care  but even her new one will do crazy stuff like freezing  or not turning on  and dont get me started on transferring pictures videos to a windows pc  total nightmare 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have never seen anyone use imessage or facetime  like ever   ppl here use whatsapp for video call  voice calling and messaging 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the only thing i love about iphones is the ability to jailbreak  mod it the way you’d want android sadly doesn’t
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no  i feel the apple is the most dumbest smartphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why did you overlook the fact that you cant download apps from outside the app store in ios  for this reason alone i think android is way better in the apps category
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,good video  tough to compare a single manufacturer apple to all of the androids  i dont even like androids outside of the pixel lineup  couldnt stand samsung  i tried the iphone for a few months and hated it  also  i realized that i did not want to have the same phone as pretty much   of people around me  that was a surprise insight 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,here is my no category  and i can bet for many others as well     do i have to re learn where everything is  and how to do things      no i dont if its an iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,two words  sideloading apps 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps are def better on android  apps that are free on android you have to pay for on apple  of course the true winner is android  you want a really cool foldable phone then its android  my grandma loves apple for a reason 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think routines can do everything focus mode does 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,at the end of the day its about  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,pixel    years xdd
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,could have added price or value for money  as that would pretty much have equaled things out for sure  apple for me simply is to expensive for what they offer  although highend android phones have become way more expensive as well in recent years  im also tech savy enough i can easily deal with android and do not value the apple ease of use that much when it limits customization  compatibility and advancements in tech  its a good thing both exist as they keep eachother sharp and force both to keep moving forward which results in better products for us all  we do not want to see one have a monopoly as that would be really bad 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i switched to android so i can run gps  robotic and machine control software from my phone  stuff that surveyors and excavation contractors use  i have no regrets once i got used to ui
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is communist 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,easy pick android for me   the reasons is thst its more flexible for me to choose what i need and what i want   want bigger screen   there is one   wants bigger battery   there is one   wants fastest chip for gaming   there is one   wants best camera wig best sensors  there is one   wants the best ui features  there is one   wants gaming or gimmicky cool stuff   there is one   wants super fast charging w   there is one   like damn its limitless
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i actually do not no how to use a iphone its so complex for meim jusy probably use  android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,where i can find the padge at    i have a google smartphone  i always search for a charge limiter  but i found nothing 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why is no one  i mean literally no one  talking about the price  iphone is shitty expensive dude  and me being an indian  this is absolutely ridiculous 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,honestly  kinda annoyed you didnt mention the fact that android allows apks  thats a huge huge feature ngl
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there is one category missing  the security  where is apple absolute winner  everyone who has a security priority should take iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i like how balanced it is  essentially both apple locks in its users  but that offers its own advantages  that said  for those who say cloud is the answer  its good to remember that being too reliant on cloud has one big disadvantage   the cloud depends on the internet  having everything on cloud has its convenience  but you also need to ensure you have connectivity  that may seem a given in this day   age  but thats simply complacency  there can be situations you have no connectivity  rare but still a possibility 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,whatever   the winner is android   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,google have now  years of updates
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,every phone is special in its own way like kids to a parent 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,focus mode has been a feature on samsung  not android  for a while
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple just works  no faffing about   it just works 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so much great information  well done 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,pixel  gets  years of os updates  android wins 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung over iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,they both have reached their top  so you will always get the one your friends like   peer pressure is always the winner
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my exeperience living in australia where some of the apple feature wont really matter is that if someone is only a bit tech savvy    of the times they have an android phone  i also strongly believe most people globally pick up iphones simply on the  ease of use basis  and knowing the new iphone matches what i was doing on my old iphone hence not as tech savy or excited about new os or features   but i agree that the real winners are customers here who get benefits of competiotion and its real stupid to take sides and be closed minded to actual benefits for each individual  i e blue vs  green bubble debate in us   i personally use android phones and mac laptops where i believe they each shine in their respective fields 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,from what i heard from people around me  iphone is better to make content to point that its almost feels like sabotage  how so  i tried to upload a video to whatsapp story  it got compressed to  quality  blurry  pixely  just bad  this isnt the case with iphone  even with the cheaper ones  se  my friends said that its similar to what happened if they tried to upload story to instagram 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,el pixel  actualizando hasta el

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use it not a real category
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have know quite a number of android users who are really iphone haters  they always have the perception that people who owns an apple is because the branding  big hype  showing off etc  they feel that they are smart in the way that they can buy a cheaper android phone and do quite the same thing  they are so self centered and they feel that every single thing android is better than iphone  they even say that android is easier to use which is totally untrue  i been telling them apple is much more straight forward in the setting and overall while android is more complicated but they allow a lot of customization which may not be easy to for less tech person  cant android user just stick to what they like and stop making accusation  i have both iphone and android phone  to me  i trust the security for iphone and i do my personal banking with iphone  and i play games on android  android has too many security issues when they allow user to install any app from the web or scanning qr codes which might be scam  whereas iphone can only download and install app from apple app store  one thing for sure iphone is always very premium in price but for the security sake  i rather pay higher price for iphone than spending lower for android and get scammed and lost even more money  it happed here in singapore so many times where scammer  leave qr code to install so called survey app to get freebies and people got cheated ten of thousands  but end of the days i think everyone should respect what phone people like to use and not always think that they have the best choice  everyone has their own priorities 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  off on  pro pre orders if on google fi   welcome new options  manual camera controls  and actual  mp photos

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  customization is clear android     features  for sure android      if you mean safety  app store  all of the seamlessly working apple apps working together  apple   currently i would say for support  updates and all that with the brand new pixel  pro with  years of life  android    apps when it comes to design  and which os devs update first  apple    excitement is tricky  but with the huge variety and the fact that you can get anything u blloody well want  android   ecosystem for me in the uk is firmly with android  especially google  nest  and pixel  android  the score   android   apple   android in the uk in my opinion atleast wins  thoughts in the comment

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i had an android a very long time ago but when i got my first iphone i knew already that i will never be switching to android again
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,please compare sony xperia  v with google pixel  pro  in terms of camera  battery drain test  speed and performance  and in hand feel
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would love a comparison video between apple and googles current ecosystems 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,always from the perspective of an iphone fanboy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,even if the iphone may edge out in a few points  apples interface and brand is not my style 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,good stuff  as always  there are plenty of reasons im all in on apple  but maybe more than anything else  i come at it through the ecosystem argument — but from a different angle than this video explored  our lives are full of different types of technology for different purposes  phones  tablets  watches  media streaming devices  speakers  headphones  and  of course  actual computers  to me  the greater consistency and  synergy  i can have among my various devices  the better  and the only company that makes serious versions of all of these — both hardware and software  at that — is apple  and they happen to do it really  really well  microsoft makes computers and sort of tablets  but no phones anymore  google makes phones and tablets but no  real  computers  sorry  chromebooks just dont count   even if an individual product were lacking in one area or another compared to a competitor  siri  for example  is a knock against the homepods despite their incredible sound quality  the benefit of feature consistency and compatibility across an entire ecosystem of devices like this is huge and  for me  cannot be overstated  universal control is honestly still a mind blowing feature to me that i use more or less all day at work  sharing keyboard mouse across two computers and an ipad with the ability to easily drag and drop between them   plus continuity camera  like marques mentioned  and the ability to copy paste between devices  or hand off particular activities to another device  or the fact that my airpods pro now seamlessly and instantly switch automatically to whatever device i start playing audio on  etc  i could go on and on  i use this stuff  all the time  and most of it wouldnt even be possible if all of my products were from different manufacturers  but even at a more basic level  it means theres one basic approach and philosophy behind the various os implementations  meaning i dont have to learn  or  completely separate ways to interact with my devices  powerful technology necessarily introduces complexity into our lives  and im all about reducing that complexity  reducing the friction  wherever i can  apple helps by providing a common design philosophy and  to some extent  design language across these various devices  and also just by [usually] being really good at making their devices user friendly   and  of course  it doesnt hurt that apples products are usually rock solid  polished  extremely performant  and  in my personal opinion  far more pleasant to use than equivalent products  but yeah  for me  it ultimately comes back to the ecosystem and the fact that there is truly no other competition on that front 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, hz is managed better on iphone and iphone doesnt have battery loss when not in use  therefore for gaming iphone  pro max and im very happy with it
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i feel like people use the iphones for ease of use its just so easy if people want a little customization then theyll move over to android  i think once apple releases the walls of the customization then youll have a much bigger influx of people using the iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,now a days choosing mobileis more complex than choosing your bride  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you want everything it’s the iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it’s more fair to compare the pixel  pro    years support on the os 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in  series they just copied every point from this video lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,searching for  why not both  comment
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think the bloatware issue on android deserves a serious look in any comparison 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,mann you crazy i think excitement is iphone  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i want your iphone wallpaper
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its funny that for this comparison  youre opening up the fold  something iphone doesnt have  hardware should have been a category  love my fold  could never go back 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,stability  i’ve noticed apple is way more stable than android  everything is polished and works flawlessly  android  not so much 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,u r iphone biased person
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,and apple carplay
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,to me personally the most important is typing in more than  languages and editing what i type  which is really very bad on iphones  even with gboard from google  you cant have more than  keyboards and on android i have    to get to the position of text that needs to be corrected on iphone takes much more time than on android  so this is the most important to me    the second customizations  maybe not even customizations  but to turn off  do not disturb is useless on iphones  remove  app icons from the main screen i dont want there  removing the complete screen on the left side  if i dont want it   want to be able to remove it  its my phone  place things the way i want  icons grouped on screens  not all sorted the way apple want me to have them   upgrades updates  dont really care   apps are incomparable  some work better on android  some on apple  we as developers keep them the same for both os  but its really more difficult to create an app that will work the same on every android than to do the same on ios  but flagships or android phones in the same price range as iphones are supported the same   ecosystem   i like it when devices work together  but  hate to be forced to stay with one brand  if i like sony headphones the best  garmin watches the best  etc  i want them to work good together and this isnt the case with iphones   excitement  i dont care about it at all   ease of use  to me personally androids are more logical and easier to use  i almost never had to search for how something is done for android where with the iphone i am searching it all the time  iphones arent easier to use  there is just enough users that had a similar problem who asked it in the internet and you can find the answer or you find the answer which tells you that simply cant be done on iphones  i cant remember of a feature that isnt available on my android and it is available on the iphone   features   iphones dont have anything that would convince me to buy one  or better to use them  because i have an iphone and an ipad but im using them only for testing the app were developing  my every day phone is an android   there are still two points that make iphones the better choice  covers  the amount of different covers for iphones is much bigger than for any other phone and that makes it girls favorite phone  the other is the value  in three years you get half of the new price for your old iphone  for samsungs its   and for sonys its   this makes it much easier to buy a new iphone every three years than with other phones and mobile operators offer them all the time in rates over  years where some brands arent offered at all   and to end my comment  im using sony phones since the beginning  i again have samsungs  huaweis  iphones for testing purposes  but the phone that convinces me the most us sony xperia  ii in my case  i cant find reasons to upgrade because it offers everything i need and its  years old already  and none of operators in my country offers sony phones   for me the clear winner is a sony phone  xperia  or   the next would be a pixel and then i dont know  for average users iphone is the easiest choice  they wont get mad if something isnt possible to do 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i just want him to say the winner at the end and cut to black
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this review is super useful as i am at the point of choosing between upgrading my iphone or moving to android  my iphone pro max is losing its battery capacity and i am looking at moving to iphone  pro max or samsung g fold  your advise in this review is super cool  thanks
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,just as he said samsung i also muttered it at   xd
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you should do a mac and windows  objective opinion  i think thatd be pretty interesting 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,clever  i see what you did right there  lol 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,an important category which was missed was privacy where apple clearly wins 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there’s an apple card widget for to see your balance ‘n stuff and i just love it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if your a retro gamer android is the undisputed champion here 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android  semi open source  better price  and not as anti consumer
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphones belongs in the 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,opinion thats all  it comes down to
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there are a lot more options for android   if i own an samsung watch and want to switch between a samsung phone and a google phone everything just works   once you dive down the apple hole you are stuck with that ecosystem   you also pay way more for the vanilla apple experience   the choice is easy   whatever is in your pocket now 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the apple ecosystem is a giant that is propped up by a toothpick sms  when the carriers finally do the right thing and drop it  people are going to eventually have to use another app like whatsapp  telegram or signal
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me it genuinely came down to managing files and storage and the fact that you can do multiple ecosystems in one phone  onedrive  samsung  google  is just too great  being american yea i hate sms and hate that apple users force me to use it but honestly most convos i have are on whatsapp now  at least for a group chat   individual sms isnt great but its not as bad 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for the first time since my iphone  was bought brand new i am excited to upgrade  i gotta say i am really looking forward to it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android es más libre  iphone es una dictadura 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,am i the only one who is thinking of adding an extra feature named  cost like  shouldnt that be a priority in itself     like  yall are gonna spend money to buy phone right  isnt that a priority in us now a days  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use == iphone  so biased
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android  because i couldnt afford apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro really put iphone up against every other phone on the market 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro no one cares about ecosystem for this because stuff like discord or whatsapp most people dont use the common app like phone imessaqge facetime because you have all of that in apps like discord whatsapp etc  and those apps are for both the ecosystem thing for iphone lovers just doesnt make sense
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love how this list just fits why for me the iphone was the choice  tried some androids mostly for work and i agree  you can customize so mutch more but i like the simple stuff and i don’t need to hit the settings all the time for everything  so i love that pepole have diffrent choice in what they can spend money on and i feel sorry for pepole that need to make fun of others choice   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,actually samsung has focus mode just like in ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, ecosystem  love how iphone users are pointing that out always  android can communicate with anything  there are literally apps for literally everything 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android best  apple shit   im out 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my man has missed the most important category   the cost  android is available in variety of prices but ios is insanely pricey  for more that   of people in the world  thats the most important category
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its not an iphone but an ios vs android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apples closed ecosystem is the biggest reason i wont switch from android  besides  i find it no problem at all to seamlessly connect devices and transfer files and be  or  swipes away from exactly what i want  everything just works on android  galaxy  spend a minute and you can easily make the ui look a lot nicer than the yawnfest that is ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have a macbook pro and pc  i have an ipad and samsung tablet  and galaxy phone  my wife has an iphone so we have some of everything 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android customization is the myspace html of facebook  just because you can  doesnt mean you should 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is the winner cause you are basically comparing it to all androids
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,can someone tell me the name of the song of the intro 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dude this was helpful and it says something that you use an android but then tally up apple barely better  somewhat subjective but nonetheless a good method 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i mean the obvious winner here is capitalism and billion dollar corporations 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the last  phone purchases  i thought  im ready to make the switch from apple to android  then i go pick up a phone and its the least intuitive experience ive ever had with a device  perhaps the customizability helps alleviate this  once you get things sorted  ive struggled to ever feel like the change would make any sense for me though 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,because of the eco system  i leave samsung to rog
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,disliked
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,quick answer  android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,never understood this ease of use argument for iphone  i find apple incredibly hard and frustrating to use while android very intuitive 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,tried galaxy a few years ago and i went back to iphone  months later  android just not my vibe 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the thing is that iphones are very good at what they do whereas androids  albeit slightly worse  can do much more stuff that the apple ecosystem straight up doesnt allow you to do 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,who wants to see mkbhd as miles morales 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you got one wrong  i have focus modes on android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,spoiler  not apple   because apple unlawfully records and uses consumers’ personal information and activity on its consumer mobile devices and applications  apps  even after consumers explicitly indicate through apple’s mobile device settings that they do not want their data and information shared  this activity amounts to an enormous wealth of data that apple collects and uses for its financial gain 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,just curious  is the phone with a wide frame pixel 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as soon as apple get multi window multitasking im okey
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dynamic island seems kinda bs is that really a feature 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would argue from a cheap consumer perspective on the apps  that you just dont have to pay for any apps on android and that u need to take maybe a slight hit in quality for the money you safe  f  e  anki costs  € in app store  none on android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,that spanish ai generated voice is weird
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its actually     draw  marques just forgot the price category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i strongly disagree on apps  on andriod uou can easily download apps by third party developers wheres with apple you are restricted unless you root the phone to get third party apps
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,someone let me know what that intro song is
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,isn’t price a factor 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how about privacy   this is one of the key features for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the real loser are us  paying kidneys for the sole purpose of getting the latest phone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how is price not part of this  this is the   reason people prefer android  you can by  android phones for the same price as one iphone with somewhat decent specs 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i remeber switching btw the  for a while but in  i bought my first samsung series  s edge  and the rest was history nothing but android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if i cant place my icons where i want  im not interested 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would have scored the ecosystem category differently  in fact  this is one of the reasons i will never own an apple  the ecosystem ethos  i dont want to be locked into a single brand for every device i own  i want st class support for any device i might want to buy  apple fanboys are douchey sycophants that want to be told what to like and how cool they are for worshipping at the altar of consumer control
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how can you forget the biggest distinction  in android your photos can be seen in both gallary and files folder   but in iphone  theyre stuck in photos    apple file manager is the worst 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,build quality is a big one for me  like the overall design  materials used and colors
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love android but because google does such a pathetic  horrible job of screening   preventing malware apps from being put on their app store aka google play  i use iphones   however  i always have my android phones that also use on the side   if google got serious about preventing apps that have hidden malware in them  from being listed in their google play app store  i would switch in a heartbeat fully back to android   apple does a wonderful job of preventing apps w hidden malware from ever being listed in their app store   google could do the same if they wanted but instead they are lazy   rely on rd party malware security companies to screen the apps after they have been made available to the public by way of being listed on the google play app store   google needs to get it’s butt sued in a major class action lawsuit that results in them having to pay out millions      then you would finally see them take app malware seriously 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im an android user in pixel   my wife is an iphone user  her phone definitely has a much better battery with gps and much less bugs  my phone will still randomly glitch out 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung ecosystem automatically takes the point  they work with other ecosystems too  its an open ecosystem it isnt enclosed like apples ecosystem  they work with windows and many other brands 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this video helped me to know that the best phone for me is an android one
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple เจาะตลาด บน จะแข่งต้อง focus ตลาดเดียวกัน
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its basically windows vs linux 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for someone as me  who expect his phone to last   years  longevity is one of major selling point  i feel like android phones are for ppl who like experiments  deep customization and switch phones more often  every year or two  because android phones just starting to fell appart in longer term  my honor  pro just fell appart both hardware and software wise after  years  i had some  xiaomi phones at my previous work that first died after   years nd in  months  also had samsung s that lasted me for  years  in my new job there was discarded iphone  lying in a drawer for about year or two  i was curiuos to try ios so i charged it up  turned it on and was shocked how snapy the phone was  it felt like a brand new  solid body  no cracks  nothing  it also downloaded its latest updates  i wish i had this kind of experience with any of my previous android phones  i still cant decide between su and iphone pro max as my new phone which should last me for  years 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one category that doesn’t apply to most people is accessibility  i will only use apple because android just doesn’t work for me  although some people really like android for that same reason  everything here is down to personal preference  i just like the ecosystem and the simplicity of it  you don’t really have to think when you’re setting up your phone because it’s all built in  sure i bet customization can be fun  its just not for me  everyone’s opinion is valid 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,not putting an icon where i want drives me crazy on iphone  we all know they’re better on the bottom 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think price value should have been a factor
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you are deffinatly pro iphone  it shows in your choices of questions 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me   ease of use   updates   features    apple may lag behind somewhat but its features are generally sufficient  excitement    apple stuff excites me more than android stuff  apps   customization   ecosystem    im a techy nerd  just like marques  but when it comes to a smartphone appliance  i just dont want to put much thought into it  i want to set it and forget it  ill put my mental energy into other  more important  things 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have to disagree on ease of use  after having used both android and iphone i’ve found that most of my regular actions take at least one more click on iphone than android  for instance  if i’m texting and want to call the person  on android you just hit the call button  on i phone you have to click the person’s name which takes you to their contact and from there you can click their phone number to call  that’s just clunky and twice as many steps for doing a very basic thing  i find this is true of nearly every major thing i do on the iphone  it takes at least one more step to accomplish it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nope stop stop… i’m done you said it the iphone wins  we are not friends them miniature little features cause apple to win in your book  then give me my pitchfork cause you can download similar apps on android  thanks for your help apple lover 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there should be an innovation category
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one is missing on the list   camera and world around it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i wish android added battery health   and every android phone have battery charge limit like samsung
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,motorola hallo moto  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for pricing follow this  cost of the phone   number of years of security updates  then factor in build quality  repairability cost  etc 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the thing that bothers me about apple is whenever apple does everyone follows  im not really into iphone since there the same phone with limited customization and features  i like samsung because of the customization  features  and is part of android  samsung started copying apple by getting rid of the features  i never understood why samsung drop the headphone jack  i got the galaxy buds and they broke down  months later   dollars for a galaxy bud to break down in  months is kind of a rip off 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ecosystem depends on where you are  its essentially a win for apple only  and only  in the us  for the average non americans  as you said  something as simple as usb c compatibility can be a more important  ecosystem 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android better than ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung has  focus  modes for at least a year
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this debate has always been flawed since its basically one phone versus all the others  when it comes to apps  the issue is way deeper than which ecosystem gets priority  quality control on android is non existant  if you want to get stranded on your holiday with your mobile banking app that doesnt work anymore due to an update  go for android  thats what i learned from publishing apps on both stores for years  apple is clearly the premium product smartphone at the moment  everything else feels cheap and simply doesnt work as well  ill gladly skip the x zoom to have a working set of apps that my life depend on 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,longtime iphone user  switched a few years ago to s  loved the phone and customisation… however i have gone back to iphone because the tight integration of ecosystem and apple pay was the primary reason i switched  samsung pay and google pay worked   of the time   i hate that apple is a rip off  i hate that apple hasn’t improved its icloud since day one   however i know what i’m getting  like a steady horse and not something that bolts
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android customization is good  iphone everything just works  i don’t have to worry about how my iphone is going to act  i don’t have to keep resetting it because of glitches or lag  it’s all around perfect for what i use a phone for  that’s why i still to iphones as my main device 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one thing that was key for me  and i strongly disagree with your opinion is regarding apps  while it is true that the vast majority of apps run better and receive updates faster on ios  android just has access to more app and more variety  ive been debating to get an ipad for awhile and the only thing stopping is that i wouldnt get access to a few apk apps that are vital for me  besides that  i completely agree with your takes  great video as always 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont think you know the definition of definitive
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps for ios  like half the apps i use are unavailable on ios  i have to open some mobile unfriendly site and use the api that way 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,focus mode is a copy of samsungs modes and routines  so is the notification  feature   samsung has it
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android developer here  the real reason iphone gets features first is because the c level execs all have iphones  been that way everywhere ive worked 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is always the best phone  iphone is has a tatoo design  every year is the same phone for more money  what a scam
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,aamzing  so genuine  how  mins passed i have no idea man
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you didn’t rate stability  android  even on stock google phones  is buggy as hell  i got my mother in law a pixel in  and out of the box  installing  whatsapp couldn’t work  an empty phone with just whatsapp installed was unstable  had to reboot and reinstall whatsapp  something like that would never happen on ios  seeing her phone a year later  it looked like a boomer’s virus infected windows pc  loads of notifications  bizarre behavior  slow as hell 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you add three more categories  film making  photography  and technical specifications i think the latest samsung will usually always blow the iphone out of the water on all three  as far as ease of use is concerned i kind of agree on the compatibility side of things where everything just works in terms of the system not crashing  but in terms of being able to do simple things like filmmaking or setting up playlists for your music  transferring things to and from the icloud or to your computer to free up space  well the iphone ecosystem really sucks  to put it bluntly and often fails and lets you down  you will tend to have more crashes with an android device overall than an ios one but the ios device is very limited in what it can do  there are some things that you just cant do on the standard ios system and its default programs  without the need for the use of other apps  and that can get very messy  whereas  with the android phone you dont have those problems of needing to use third party apps  i would actually say the android devices particularly the samsung ones are ahead of the apple iphones in  out of  areas 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is always the winner in my book  android for life
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,such a usa point of view
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is the best
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is the best
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me  the closed filesystem of iphone makes it a no go  and i like to set custom ringtones even in  and most likely even in the future  d custom ringtone is super easy on android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,at this point imma just use both 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps  apple  how  you can download apk for android  so apps are androids 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no empire lasts forever 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’m just glad i can set more than one timer on ios  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,customisation   android  feature   android  ease of use   iphone  i dont think so  update support   iphone apps   android iphone   quality and quantity   excitement   android ecosystem   iphone   samsung also doing it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use does not really exist on an iphone   i try to transfer some file on an iphone with the cable   never managed to successfully do it   its notting easy on an iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i ike both android and iphone  android for the many customization options  iphone for its seamless integration and  efficiency when using it in my business 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android for sure
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,price is also a big consideration for consumers  for android there many options available at much lower cost 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i can understand why the average american user likes iphone but for me as someone who prefers customization  faster charging  higher gpu  more consistent gaming  less restrictions  longer battery life  rog  ultimate  and no excluding the charger upon purchase of devices  apple products sound like a nightmare to me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how the hell do you jon a facetime from a android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ooohhhhhhh  i think that that second case  was a little off  i think that apple wins that one  and not andriod  as  well  some of the  features  like battery management etc  is well  a setting  a customising thing  not a feature  also  no sat sms  no mention of the health things  or crash alerts etc  those are feature that  while in the sense of sat sms  hardware  but crash alerts that is a true life saving feature  and to my best awareness  there is nothing on android that matches that
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the i am in the usa part is really important here  as most of the times  only americans have the whole ecosystem setup or has very strong preference of imessage or facetime 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the answer is android  why is that for sure the right answer   because there are vastly more android devices  so you can get exactly what you want  if i could have any phone it would be a powerful foldable  only available with android as of now
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,imo apps are not a win for apple just because there are so many apps you can download from the internet in the form of apks its insane 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,come on brownlee  dynamic island was on android first and you should have said that  but seriously nobody uses the different focus modes  its a waste of space on the iphone  ask in your next iphone video no one uses them 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,paid by apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wait  whats with the monitor on the right  theres like a strange  quite funny  censor box hidden there 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,of course you’re gunna pick apple …  you’d prolly suck up tim cook if you could
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,cant freaking remove animations on ios  too closed off  ill never get ios unless they change some policies 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,he didn’t mention that when you buy or rent youtube videos  its more expensive in the iphone  my wife has the pixel  and there’s always a   difference
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,fairphone use android  so android is better  right to repair is the most important thing 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’m shocked you would create  categories and not include privacy  as a core category considering our phones have become our most intimate and personal technology   privacy seems a no brainer 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ecosystem was so poorly handled  why wasnt a single factor that if you have any other pc than apple  like for example everyone who remotely is into gaming needs can go f  themselves with an apple  why does he say both are kinda equally good but then completely ignores that one forces you into buying the same brand across every type of device
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in the ease of use i think the android is better bc i usually see more old people being lost in the iphone interface than the android and even i get lost when i need to use the iphone from one of my friends bc its so non intuitive
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video and i agree with most of your takes  but one thing that you didn’t mention when comparing app stores is how ios apps are generally much more expensive  for a rank and file guy like me  that weighs in pretty heavily 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hey marques  would you say out loud that the android has the technical debt  being slower  at a daily use after some time  draining more power  iphones have less mahs  but more screen time  and starting to lose at the customization department to ios  criticism is better than saying  good in their own way  its a force to make better things
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what makes me stick to android phones as much as i do is just how free you feel with customization  you will always be able to mess with both software and hardware  of your phone  since you can install external memory and phone parts with no consequences  not to mention the presence of apks  you say quality over quantity  but the real quantity of apps on both sides is usually trimmed by region restrictions  apks fix that very easily  iphone on the other hand  you are heavily cuffed by apple  since no sd cards means you will have to rely on external acessories or icloud  which  discredits iphones in the  ecosystem  category  since cloud storage = massive servers = electricity to run = more carbon emissions  and the various issues with the non repairability is extremely funny  + i get   more base ram on a lite version  then the extra ram bumping that number to   apple get your ram together jeez 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is best
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the charging percentage limit on android is a game changer   fingers cross its will added to iphone  d
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have oppo  for me its like an apple android  sleek  powerful hardware and an amazing camera with a great battery and not so cluttered minimalistic design 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im gonna have to say the app point is just not valid  that shouldve gone to android  we have access to more apps cheaper apps  apps that arent in the store anymore  apks  i will aggree with people saying that if there was a security post  apple would probably win  but its one of those ones where theoretically both could win
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you made this legit  weeks too early
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i was given an iphone at work and tried for a long time to do without android  but finally gave up and bought a cheap chinese umidigi g plus with which i can finally listen to music from youtube and other applications and websites that do not have equalizer  android allows developers to create special equalizer apps   but ios sorry no  i also like to listen to music and audiobooks before bed at minimum volume using my own rather than apples super expensive bluetooth headphones  on the iphone  the volume goes from zero to immediately too loud for me   precise volume control is completely impossible  on android  i can go into developer mode and do a double volume control   i can adjust the volume on the phone itself and separately with the buttons on the headphones  on the iphone  pressing the buttons on the headphones just changes the volume on the phone itself  this is also the default mode on recent versions of android   but on android i can get rid of this mode and have a more fine tuned volume setting  as for ios  all i see is yelling and complaining from users who have been asking apple for years to make finer volume control   but apple ignores them  i recognize that the iphone has its advantages  especially for undemanding users  and iphones make great video  without allowing you to record it on a micro sd card  but if you want to use the phone for listening to music and audiobooks   its better to buy android where you can use sd card up to one terabyte and you can just take and insert this card into your computer to copy files like a regular external disk  where you can run an equalizer application that will improve the sound even if you listen to free youtube  and most importantly   you can adjust the volume at your will and not at apples will to sell you headphones for the price of  chinese phones   each of which for me personally is more convenient than ios  in general  iphone is more expensive to use  apple always wants you to buy and pay  android is cheaper and more flexible  especially for users willing to tinker with their phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,brutal que lo pueda escuchar en español 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i care primarily about retro emulation like psp  gamecube ps  psp  etc  and the ease of attaching game controller on it  i dont think iphone can give me that 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,very good way of doing this comparison on a personal basis  rating those features at the end was just pure class  great video
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would add a category just for viruses  apple hardly ever gets one and every cheap pc gets one  i had the same macbook pro for  yrs with no issues  the only reason i got rid of it was because it started slowing down with large video uploads and i plan on having my new one for yrs  you simply cant do that with a  regular  pc  they will crash and get a virus and die within yrs 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,por que me sale doblado al español  suena horrible
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is a winner
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,man said put your pitchforks down 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,androids freedom and accessibility is most important  i dont have to deal with software locks  software updates that are effectively malware  see apples   million lawsuit  and i can download third party apks  like my yt app that has removed features that i hate and no advertisements    ive been doing it like this since   switching to ios would be a major downgrade  as i wouldnt be able to do half of what i currently do on android os  my qol would absolutely tank 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have an iphone and a nothing phone   no one said you cant have both 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,by apps you could award it to either one but you factored in esse of use yet again 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would say that it is not totally fair to compare iphone with every other android function out there across all phones in existence  why  cause you probably wont find any android phone that hasevery feature mentioned in this video  comparing iphone to a particular android phone would be a much better way   cause if we compare iphone to a pixel for example  i wouldnt say that pixel is more customizable  yea  you can make a few tweaks  but nothing critical  they dont even let us hide that annoying google search bar from the main screen 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video that you made here  i am on the android side always  still you gave some good points for apple  thanks
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is way easier to use than iphone  going back in apps is so unintuitive and having pop ups constantly confuse people about storage and apple pay makes the ease of use for a layman very annoying 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont think apple wins in ecosystem  they actually lack  if you stick with one brand you will be just fine with samsung or google or apple ecosystem but the best thing is with android u can have pixel phone with a xiaomi tablet and samsung smartwatch and windows laptop  they will all  speak  to each other with google services  so you can chose any brand and device fits you better and you know they will work together  for apple it only works when u use their products as soon as u prefer the another device apart from apple it will be difficult the add it to your apple ecosystem  i know they made this on purpose but for me it is not an advantage  it is actually a down point for their ecosystem  at least thats just my point
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the apps thing was really not thought through  what about apps that arent available on ios  well your sol  on android just get the apk    several apps and games are available for free on android and are not on apple    you can also do development work on androids  force changes on apps and even do debugging if youre loading custom apps    there are more androids sold  which means greater app support and availability and longer term too  because developers stand to make more despite the differences from phone to phone  apple also nails devs more on transactions    what if youre super concerned about privacy  apple got a terrible rating on tosdr  with android  if youre concerned you can remove all system apps with adb or flash a custom image of android and choose the apps and access they have  theres a reason android is winning the race    americans need to get with the times and stop complaining everytime a chat bubble changes colour  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there is no best  it is just  good ways of doing it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,fair video
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when it comes to ease of use i like the fact that with android you can do whatever you want  even boot another os image in case you dont like the one you have  you can get rid of the bloatware  have even another set of apps in a  work profile  without having to create another  user profile  having multiple accounts for lets say whatsapp or telegram  and of course the ability to get apps from open source  i was able to optimize my parents phones since they were not wanting to change the ones they use  the extended life you can get from an android is crazy good whereas the iphone becomes a very expensive paperweight whenever they no longer support the older devices 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is better   i’m an iphone user lol  god i miss being able to use two apps at the same time

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the way you speak is like being careful not to step on the toes of either of the companies that support you  and that my friend is selfish biasness  i am very capable and tech and i own my own company name everythingtech i have use android for more than half my life i have use ios for the remaining half  the truth is is that they do have their advantages and disadvantages  but apple will always come out the winner  premium product is just expected to function at the capacity that they function at so trust me when i say if apple was a cheaper device the world would mostly use it and guess what  it’s not the cheapest device and still more of the world uses it  dude just check the facts
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android users are not pressured into a phone because everyone else has one  they have a phone that is good to them

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no my friend not that came from android it’s that came for jailbreak developers  the jailbreak community contributes more to apple new upcoming features than any inspiration you think comes from android  mark  i respect u but one part of your brains in missing and that’s the part that understands the entire full functionality of jailbreaks and jailbreaking in general  do me a favor sit and review all of the jailbreak tweaks for bad then to now and you’ll see that the jailbreak community contributed more to ios being better than android ever did and when u do do the research shout me out in a video and possibly acknowledge that this area wasn’t one you were too verse in until you opened up to every aspect of how the ideas to ios os truly functions  thanks  names reinhold charles

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i only have one point to make toward this video  i understand apps are often made with ios in mind first  but really  when an app thats free on the play store costs   on the apple app store  its really not even a competition for me  i like the app store  and im swapping back and forth between the xr and an s fe depending on what i need at the time  family member who texts a lot is on iphone and when he sends images theyre always blurry unless im using the iphone thanks to apples insistence on not changing to the newer messaging protocols  galaxy when i need to take a photo of something because  while ios camera software is really good  the camera on the xr is  not  but really  as someone studying languages  the inability to use my account on the iphone really hinders that for me  niche case  sure

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is the winner  simply look at the market share   of cell phones run on android  on   run on apple os  apple users are just loud and complain a lot

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is an interesting exercise   i love all oses except ios   my big problem with ios is all the artificial limitations   the a is useless if you cant even do basic things like split screen apps or copy photos directly from your phone to your computer   i also think simple is often conflated with easy   ios has less options  but for me  this missing options make the product harder to use   the ui cannot be scaled smaller  safari is the only browser engine  apps can only be installed from the app store   these are all things that make using an iphone an infuriating experience for me   as a result my iphone  sits in the box   of the time   my ipad mini  has been relegated to youtube duty although stage manager would have helped even if it is a weak solution   i did this and had android  to  with ios getting  of the  points on updates   updates are important to me  but i use pixels to bridge the gap a bit   also  apples ecosystem  a  point category for me  is awesome  but it is not perfect   i tried universal control a lot the first month it came out and over half the time my mouse would not connect to my ipad mini  at all   not sure what thats about   i think apple can really bridge the features and customization gap by hiding the things behind one expert mode toggle or something   then maybe ios would be worth using   also   android is super simple to use with defaults   no curveballs  atleast with pixels at a minimum   customization is optional not required

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,good video and i agree   agree with the conclusion that which os is better is always dependant on the individual because both have their pros and cons  however there are definitely glaring  categories  that youve missed out  including privacy  security  and price  the first two are definitely a win for apple by a very long mile  and  of the main reasons why i personally ended up going with ios over android after finally having to leave my beloved windows phone behind  whereas price is definitely a clear winner for android just due to the vast variety of different price points   there are other things i personally wish you had delved into deeper like the hardware fragmentation of android or the lack of sideloading on ios  but those arent necessarily as important things for everyone as the  points i made above 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,love from 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,try the s or  ultra before you destroy android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the ecosystem is the biggest issue for android apple users
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is better than apple  i dont understand why these techs wont kill the iphone  maybe because iphone makes them so much money
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one thing i think was missed on the comparison is price point  i think thatd make it   based on the fact you can pick up an android operating phone sooo unbelievably cheap
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the bug you were taking a picture of at   is a spotted lantern fly   invasive species  devastating to us crops and trees 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apples calculator the hardest to use app  and no back button and everything  apple sucks at ease of use   and most important thing apple doesnt have cracked app and dont allow me to root and modify system   apple gets a big not for me  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  yes 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ecosystem is why i care so much about apple products
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dude  you basically missing the main features from apple  but who cares  i love my phone and i don’t need to customise it  not everyone wants that 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i used to switch between both ios and android ever few years  ive had most gens of iphones and budget to flagship and even foldoing androids  and as much as ive enjoyed both at the time i always feel better with an iphone  the simplicity  the ecosystem  the way of ease  logging in anywehre  apple pay  its all too good and i feel android doesnt quite have that  perfect  feel yet 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the real winner is android  ios   you making this video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont feel like apple is competing  just trundling on good will developed in the s and s
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as a iphone user  android is the winner  their phones offer so much more  do a lot more and are just better  iphone has a great camera  that’s about it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in my opinion they are both the same shit just different flavors  are there any overall important features that an iphone has over android  or vice verse  i mainly choose iphone because it tends to be the most convenient… and i’ve gotten better longevity out of my iphone than any android phone i’ve owned 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is the real one here
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i don’t see why these people aren’t going to china and doing a mate review
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i went into this thinking its just going to be one of those bias comparisons but mk was very thorough and real about this and for that he has my respects again   i started with iphone  because it was a game changer  then after a couple of years  android caught up and iphone basically didnt have nothing else to offer except getting more expensive  so i moved to oneplus and i was sold  that was my first android and ive been stuck since then  today i have the xs and my oneplus t  guess which one i use as my primary phone  the t 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think your discussion regarding app prioritization is a really key point  i’m someone who switched over to ios after using android forever  and overall i’m pretty nonplussed about the change  there are some things i like  some things i miss  but overall my day to day experience hasn’t really changed as much as i anticipated  but one thing i instantly noticed was how much better the vast majority of apps ran on ios  there’s a pretty noticeable difference in terms of responsiveness  smoothness  even design to some degree 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont have to watch this video  if you want aesthetics and security  you go iphone  in todays world of spying and data exploitation the latter is the only feature that really matters 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,just as a reminder apple designed and holds the patent on the usb c connector    and don’t forget how well ios and macos integrate 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,at the end of the day  ios beats android hands down 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the answer for me is to carry both phones  an iphone for its ecosystem exclusive apps  no brainer experience and the social status factor  which heavily exists in my country  and an android which suits any specific needs you may have for third party apps  file management  gaming and video toolbars  a back button swipe for one hand usage  ios back buttons are on the top left  watching full screen videos without the black pill shape and finally an amazing personalization experience 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think it would be fair to say that those who are interested in true innovation at some cost  choose android  if you want a seamless very basic experience  choose apple    still blows my mind people buy iphone though  i bought my gf the iphone  from her iphone   and i legitimately couldnt tell the difference  like not up to each other  but if i were to pick up one phone from another on different tables or a different room  i wouldnt be able to tell the difference   i gave up on the iphone after the who iphone  fiasco and the battery  but to each their own  i tune into these videos because im always curious  hahahaha
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i  had  android  phones   samsung    lg   sony   and after i bought and   i  was  in with my iphone se      im never back to android  ever 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the fact that you gave the iphone the win on the apps section is such and underrated stroke of genius  as a developer who also uses both android and ios  it hurts when someone says android is better because they have more apps  and apps that can do more than on ios  some of the best apps weve ever gotten were only made possible because of the unique culture that ios development nourished   i still remember when the best apps started on ios and then when they became popular would get adapted to android  apps like instagram before being bought by facebook  more simple apps like clear that made regular tasks a pleasure to use  apollo  rip  and even games like letterpress  quality over quantity indeed   i wont even mention the nightmare of compatibility devs face trying to make a non standardized ecosystem on the android side  like the lack of a good camera api and why snapchat had the worst photo quality ever for a solid decade 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i clicked this video just to comment  stop click baiting us   i know you are gonna say they both good in their own way without even watching the video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i really wanted to like android and tried switching a while back  i thought i cared about all the customization but i spent a day in frustration fiddling with all the options and bloatware that at some point i realized that i care much more about ease of use  as much as i dont like apple i had to switch back  i will still always be a pc guy though  macs can eat a dick 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,sad that in the app category you didnt mention sideloading apps  might not win it for android but is a very important consideration
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you should have had privacy as a top level feature 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i had the samsung s+ for almost  years and i wanna switch to iphone  pro max and im torn and i said i will never switch to iphone but now im on edge wanting to trying iphone again
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,unrelated but the spanish audio dub absolutely sucks  it sounds ai          if anyone asks  youtube automatically puts the shitty spanish dub instead of the original audio  why  language settings cuz i speak spanish as well as english 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you can buy a decent android phone for £  you cant even buy a basic apple device for that  why was price not even a catagory for this video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is just much better value for money
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when i tried to enter the samsung ecosystem  when the s ultra had recently launched  i hated it so much   i bought the galaxy watch classic  i think it was the   the galaxy ear buds  the beans  and the s ultra  i started the configuration of the three devices and every action that i was doing was raising a different error  when i was pairing the galaxy watch  i was just informed that an error occurred  only in the third time that it would properly finish the configuration  but after it was configured  the notifications werent arriving  the buds  well  it has the same connection that apple does and that works fine  but they were disconnecting for so many times that i just lost the count   it could be because it was new  yes  sure  but ive never had such bad experience with apple devices before   and dont get me wrong  i honestly dont like apple  the macbook i use it solely because im a developer and its much better to work with macos  and i dont play games at all so windows its just not my thing  and the imessage  i just cant enjoy that because i dont live in the us and all my friends and contacts use whatsapp   but truth be told  in apple  everything just works   and i would love to see any other small or huge company to build the same ecosystem as apple built so that it could be a real competitor against apple  i hate the fact that im trapped into this company 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,did anyone see his hand disappear after customization
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i miss my old android  it had widgets way better ios had that  and that was in 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i feel when it comes to ease of use  thats androids area 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,imho closed ecosystems are not an advantage  they are a disadvantage  only open ecosystems are a net benefit    i love my iphone   but damn i hate apple for the almost unlimited mountain of shit they do to us 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple wins apps my azz
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wowowow slow down tiger  i think google has had  years of updates for  years now  and they are rumored to go up to  years   still hate apple  but love my iphone  but hate i cant move apps proper on the homescreen  + all the other crap i cant do  but gotta like the less telemetry crap sent and the better data security   fuck us  it aint easy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphones are just more popular  but still android is better  android doesent need popularity  to make better phones 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,sadly the conclusion goes to only two systems  no more competitors  we missing windows and blackberry os  and this video at the end of the day is nonsenses  save  min of your life   publish videos just to get the bills is not fair  if u like apple iphone  you dont like apple  android  your welcome
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the ecosystem should be either an equivalent result or an android  you just picked apple for american apps  thats not the point of the  ecosystem  topic android is clearly the winner and besides  you have a mac and apple air pods max on your right table   and at the end you even said that there is no objective winner for me as a person video title not  which system is more convenient for you   clickbait
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marques  usb c = android  apple  hold my beer
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, seeing iphone wins for ecosystem  france  let me tell you something about iphone  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,excellent balanced review  funny enough  i use a samsung z flip  but have so much fun with my apple ipad  although others have tried to convince me to give the iphone a try  even just to say ive tried it  i am still not wholly convinced 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you gave apps to apple  ridiculous android wins by sideloading alone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the iphone is the phone you definitely recommend to older folks  less tech savvy friends  or  hype beasts  since you cannot compete with how easy everything works with apples ecosystem  and their update support is just unmatched  but man i personally can never go back to the iphone every thing marques said about android being the reason he prefers that os applies to me as well  i will push it a bit further than him though and mention apks  you could add apps that normally both companies dont have on their stores that are honestly games changers 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios file manager is so annoying  samsung continues to rule 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,please  get rid of the spanish audio  i have to switch to english everytime  its completely ridiculous man  probably its useful for others but youtube does not give a chance to setup this correctly yet
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’ve used both for an extensive time  and while ios has cool features  they quickly got boring  and the main os is just way too restrictive for my taste
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what the hell is this title  use iphone vs samsung use ios vs oneui this us the same like saying  lenovo vs unix
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so the price of pixel  has drastically reduced down to   inr  whereas nothing phone  starts from   inr on flipkart  according to you  what should be the ideal option  i am currently looking to upgrade from galaxy a 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro obviously likes iphone so cant say much about it  basically just wasted  mins on this useless debate for no reason 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thats the thing about marques  hes so famous now he has to be diplomatic 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,but for the average joe  the winning factor for the best phone is the resale value  in some places the iphone is somewhat of status symbol…  then many would want their phone to retain their value when they upgrade  the iphone is the best phone to resell because their value does hold unlike many android phones  peace out 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i had android before and my latest one  samsung galaxy note  was just so hard for me to navigate  i moved to iphone  from that samsung and i have no regrets  easy to use  felt great in my hand  just the phone for me  now ive upgraded and im still happy  it is very personal and i wouldnt dare say iphone is the best  its just the best for me  the ecosystem is another thing  i have both macbook air and apple watch and its very handy for me how these devices work together  great video  made me think a lot and confirmed my choice for a phone i already have 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,new category  price winner  android apple can keep nitpicking and delaying that screen fingerprint while even patenting the  i  they love using despite the semantic ludicrosity 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i hope you squished that lanternfly after taking a video of it  if you see it kill it  highly damaging and invasive 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,click bait
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its getting to a point now where apple just feels like its releasing the same phone  plus everything is so expensive for them where im starting to think i will switch to a samsung for my next phone  ive had an pro for  years now but these new iphones feel like such a scam 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i used android my whole life and switched to iphone pro because i value ease of use and don’t care for all the customizations and such  all i have to say is there are glaring issues with iphone that drive me insane  the keyboard swipe texting and autocorrect are absolutely garbage  the fact i have to have a lockscreen password when i have apply pay  which i have to unlock with a passcode anyways even if the phone is already unlocked  is absolutely dumb  the notification system is horrible  there are multiple straight up bugs in the lock screen that are super repeatable  for example  type in wrong password  it auto deletes  of the numbers imputed but not the first  so when you go to type in your password   you type   and you got it wrong again  so while also at a lockscreen that should just have a fingerprint scanner  and one i didn’t want to be locked anyways  i am now battling with a bugged pin style password screen that is making me want to throw my phone at the wall  your phone is locked and you want to change what bluetooth device your phone is connected to  okay swipe down hood the bluetooth logo to enter the device list  wrong  type in your password  okay i type it in so now it willl open the device list  wrong it turns off bluetooth  it does this every time you follow that pattern from the lockscreen  such easy ease of use issues just are not tackled on iphone  notifications are garbage  bluetooth i find is a disaster and not just for this aforementioned issue  autocorrect and swipe texting are bad  also did i mention that my oneplus t had better  faster and more reliable face recognition than my  pro  and it also had a fingerprint scanner  iphone needs to just take care of some basic shit because i’m debating going back to android after one modern iphone  such easy issues completely ignored 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,personally  i prefer android for a very strong point  which is being able to divide the screen and use several applications simultaneously  without having to exit the application or have an extra screen 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this solved a lot of peoples problems lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i loved android customization back in the days  but now i think iphone is perfect  camera and software is absolute best  things like airdrop and now the namedrop are some features i cant live without  also switching phones is so much easy  i still remember a year back i had to switch my iphone because it was broken by accident  and literal took me half hour to switch to new iphone without any issues  all my settings  data and everything was in my new phone  that would’ve been a challenge on android  because each android phone comes with different settings and stuff from the specific model and companu
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i had been an iphone fanboy till  when i got the taste of android and switched sides  i just loved the way android lets you customise your phone the way you want it and that for me was the biggest reason for the switch and ive been happy ever since 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well for me i use android its the best for me apple i just dont like its has limited features and also many apps are made for android so i will always choose android it is easy for me   well it might differ from person to person bcuz of the way they use and for what they use but  i gotta be hones android vs apple android will always win just think about pixel easy to use and many advantages 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one thing not discussed is one of the things you rely on most often  and that is unlocking your phone   as both an iphone   and android  s  user  the iphone wins hands down   the galaxys face unlock is horrible  as is the under screen fingerprint sensor   ultimately i wasnt able to use a glass screen protector with my s and yes  that as even after increasing touch sensitivity and taking multiple fingerprint scans   iphones face id works seamlessly in all light conditions  and for that reason alone i would choose an iphone as my daily driver 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is better only in  updates and support if you ask me  because i use a samsung device     i cant give  ease of use  to a phone with no dedicated back button or gesture  there are a lot of features that are easier to access or use in iphones  but this goes to android for many other features too  for me and most of the people  ease of use  is the ability to use my device however i want  iphone only allows users to use the device as they want  just having a better auto camera is not enough to justify  ease of use  can iphones open up a pop up split view calculator when i need it  does iphones have a convenient side edge panel to access whatever app  settings  tool that i want when im doing something in my phone  iphone doesnt even have half the number of widgets compared to android  doesnt that come under ease of use  doesnt aod come under ease of use   hz scrolling a universal cable fast charging all these come under ease of use and even a   android phone gives these basic features  iphone doesnt for its base varients  even though they are more expensive     apps  apps may me more optimised in iphones  but atleast android gives me the freedom to use whichever app i want  i dont have to polish neither apples nor googles shoes to use my apps  i mean even if you are saying that these are secured by iphone and google  the truth is that both these companies are monitoring every bit of your usage  another thing is that samsung is stepping up their app optimisation  just open instagram in an ipad and samsung tab side by side and youll understand which one is better optimised   ultimately  these two features are based on how you see  ease of use  and  apps  the apple fans think of these two things within apples bubble  for them ease of use is default actions and all  but for android users ease of use is the ability to use the full potential of the device that they bought with their hard earned money and customising it to suit their ease of use  because everyone has different ways to get things done  android allows this flexibility  while whatever features you get in apple in the for of  ease of use  is constrained to apples rules  they decide  you just follow   p s  i live in india  so imessages  apple pay and facetime are not at all popular 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,yea when iphone  has  x zoom tele lens  samsung will have put a x telescope on their note   its like that 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you know this is bull crap  all phones should be supported indefinitely  what is this ridiculous crap with  years support or  years support  we are all scammed by these companies  they make these devices to break  to be hard to repair  a damn battery replacement is hard to do these days  they cut updates and worse security updates because they are manipulating us into buying more devices  this is abusive capitalism  whats worse is that the devices arent even much better  i should be able to use my phone  years from now if i want to  but i cant cause i would basically be risking my freaking life if someone hacks me and empties my accounts and why  cause freaking x or y company dont want to update my device even if it can be updated  sorry but the real video isnt about iphone vs android  its about which of them is penetrating us more 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i feel like just go for what your friends and family use   if they all use iphone use iphone if they use android use android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,just by having the gesture control  the android wins for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  correct analysis and results  as an android user i must admit  that apple ios is the better one as an os and better tool for most people  but  double price and so on
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,can we talk about the ease of use of the keyboards on androids  so much better 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,can we talk about the ease of use of the keyboards on androids  so much better 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android has apks from the internet  huge diff in point apps for android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i def relate to ease of use  whole reason i went back to iphone to begin with  i had to be honest with myself and was not customizing things as much as i used to given the nature of my career  then add in the fact that working in the technological industries most people use iphone  air drop has been a life saver for my photography gigs and over all it just works  had some really bad luck on the android side where i had to download third party apps to even use basic features such as camera  phone and texting to be able to get in touch with clients  it was time to upgrade and just made the swap  i love that you also do not make this list as a definite winner for everyone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would say the same if ill get money from apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for apps you missed that apps can be sideloaded on android meaning if youre willing to be  unethical  you can get any app on android for free and often without ads 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,drop in the ocean but please tell iphone we want to reset our notes paswords
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have focus mode on my tecno android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,can you play mario or contra with help of emulator on iphone i guess not
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,love how every time you pan to android benefits you show seven different makers  apple is a single manufacturer an honest comparison would be with other manufacturers  the dishonesty of android had it first is palpable one android from  years ago that didn’t sell could do it doesn’t mean android as a system has the feature  base android and base ios would be a fair comparison if not include jail broken and tweaked ios versions since that’s what your including with android

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there is missing a category that is absolutely a must for   everyone  autonomy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ecosystem  apple     android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,only problem with samsung is their customer service is horrendous
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i hate focus  when i buy a phone i know an iphone is going to get at least  years of updates  and as we get further to future it will last longer 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what i truly want to know is which battery is better is it the android or the apple i cant seem to get a purelyy accurate battery drain test
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you try to make apple a competitor but its not  its lebron  ios  or jordan  droid  and most of the time its jordan that will be the choice  when you have a iso system you dont own it  if you did you can do what ever you want with it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android has a free youtube app without adds  nuff said 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you can set the charge limit to   in ios  did you know that before making the vid 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,imessage   whats that   have you heard of whatsapp  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video  thanks marques 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,web os
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as an samsung  yall know that you cant ask for chargers cus everyone has that lightning cable 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,having both is better  use android as a daily driver  and use iphone to receive files thru air drop from other people
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,good job  but i would not really agree with  apps  category first of all  from my point of view as a developer its much more easier to release upgrade on the android  verification goes faster  yeah  prioritization still depends on company choise  but bank app i use aleays releases new features on the andriod first  they develop both in parallel but android always passes verification faster  secondly  on the android you can install apps outside of the official play market  it can benefit if your app  for example  is removed from ofiicial store  hello russians  its again about choise and freedom  for example  you can download telegram from their official website and get updates immediately  before play market or app store  thats why i would give  app  point to the android  p s  from developer perspective andriod gives you freedom how to make your app  while apple like always tells you how to do it  correctly  thats also why their verification takes more time 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i just switched to iphone from exclusively android and specifically pixel  the biggest thing that i miss so far is the lack of universal back gesture swipe from either side of the phone like on my pixel  other than that  everything else has been pretty minor 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i know without watching that the apple has long expired 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use and updates arent nearly as important as features  customization and variety choice  they are afterthoughts  even for someone who isnt a quick learner with tech theyll be just fine with an android device its not nuclear science
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if appple were a chinese company american would be crazy that such a dictatorship company exists 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,easy mode  on samsung for the slow ppl
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,competition is not as efficient as teamwork  my friend 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i used to be a big android fan  always poking fun at apple  but two years ago i switched to apple  and honestly  for an average joe phone user like me  it’s not that different    the biggest reason for me was the availability of repair parts  before that i had a samsung galaxy s i think it was  but when the screen broke  it would have cost me almost as much as a new phone  so i looked at the replacements for apple  non original of course  and decided that that’s worth it   but who knows  maybe my next phone will be a fairphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think the real question should be ios vs android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,let me guess iphone is better like always on your videos lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,id argue ios is less easy to use because androids back button  home  and multi task are litterally one tap away right next to where our thumb is  on ios you have wipe  reach top left etc  which is harder for new users to get used to  less intuitive  and slower 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,these phones are technological wonders   android apple are both amazing 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple for me wins      security     features     ease of use     customisation     apps     ecosystem     updates     excitement  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i honestly do not care about the iphone vs android war  but i do think android is better bc so many android phones bave amazing features that iphone doesnt have or will finally get  or  years after android  i mean they still cant even change their text message colors  thats kinda basic  i remember when my iphone friends were all excited about having widgets and i was like ive had those for so long now  iphone is great for many things sure  but i do like my samsung products better 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android rocks  ios meh
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it should be ios vs android because android is an operating system  not smartphone brand 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone wins as his main phone is the pixel fold an  phone at base  thats a lot of money to spend on android if you prefer apple just saying
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my company decided to switch our phones to iphone instead of android  i hate it
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,airbus or boeing  i guess both are ok 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,watching this video because i have an iphone and an android tablet 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i want to add related to updates support that the iphone s still gets ios updates  security updates  not major versions features  and that is a  years old phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i hope one day  samsung creates is own ios  i have a xiaomi redmi note  pro  its a great phone  but android ruins everything  i understand why a lot of people stopped using android and bought iphone  i live in europe and its like that 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one  category you shouldve added was security  i know that apple updates their phones continuously if theres a security threat  take for instance what just happened with ios   we are now on     i feel very  when i use my apple  iphone  i dont know about android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ecosystem is the sole reason i buy apple products  got a macbook for work years ago and just slowly shifted everything over the ability to just take notes or do work on my laptop and keep my stuff synced is too nice  that being said if apple could put literally any effort into making siri not shit so i could justify buying a homepod and having an integrated home assistant that would be peachy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i will give the ease of use category to android  even though you have plenty of features and customization  if you are not a tech nerd like most people  you just dont use them  ive never seen an android person not knowing how to switch between the apps or go back with an app but ive seen people having iphones for years struggling on the most basic phone tasks 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what watch band is that
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i gotta say that google pixel android  have a very good thing going for it  its theme and animations is extremely nice and  apple level  its more pixel vs iphone if you ask me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,should have added  cost  as one  majority of the people buys phone thinking about budget 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont know why im watching this video  curiosity  probably   for me the answer is simple  winner is the one that doesnt need me to sell a kidney  everytime i buy a phone nor force me to stay in its ecosystem  i like options 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i found this analysis to be highly subjective it doesnt even take multitasking into consideration  it ranks apple as the best in updates when  in android  you have all the community driven updates like xda  thanks to it being open source  it also fails to consider basic functionalities like file sharing  which is a hassle in ios  not to mention attempting to use the smartphone for file storage through a usb cable  on top of that  it only considers the united states in the rest of the world  are there apple stores everywhere   no  this is honestly quite poor  please label it as a video sponsored by apple before wasting our time 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  ¿tiendas de apple en todas partes  ¿en qué parte del mundo ¿o yo vivo en otro planeta 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,itunes for me is the worst thing about iphones 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im pretty sure who is for you the winner  without watching the video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the problem is my number one is durability  i stay with iphone because they have lasted me   years when i was getting galaxies they would need to be replaced every   years
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,info on that cube desktop case in the back  ive been looking for something like this 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as an app developer for both android and ios  the  ios comes first before android because of less difference in device specs  is no more  it definitely was in the ios  days  you had  screen sizes vs  + for android and the percentage of people that wanted to pay for your app on ios was way higher  so yhea easy choice  then for features in the app we still have that many apps are written twice in their native language to give that native ios feeling  but this becomes less every year because writing your app once for multiple platforms is just cheaper and more efficient from a company point of view and more platforms like react and flutter provide this for you  the real feature differences you will find are the ux rules that apple and android will dictate and some hardware differences that the latest iphone has vs the latest android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in the  items list  you missed the  security 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,let me guess they will be equal
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i feel like apple and nintendo have a lot in common  thinking back to the wii u and how nintendo thought all those p games on rival consoles from  years ago would be enough to carry them through that generation  basically slow to change and getting things years after everyone else
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android have focus mode
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so many people are calling this an unbiased review    i am not sure they understand the meaning of unbiased    this was totally based on his opinion which makes it a biased review 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,focus mode is there in my samsung ms 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have been using android my whole life and honestly i do like it better than ios but i am thinking of getting an iphone so i could see how is life from the  other side  and experimenting a little but idk if i should
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the problem with this android vs ios debate is that it’s  company vs +  apple does great when you consider that  but of course not perfect 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i use both just like you  why not just use both  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i live in chicago and there is only like two or three apple stores in the entire city how is that a win for support 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is really not an app winner lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when i got my first iphone  which is still a  pro  i actually liked a lot of features and it truly feels  expensive  the ios is pretty and feels smooth  but what i immediately hated was  that i couldnt use a custom notification sound  using telegram i also noticed that apple cencors a lot of shit  like regular profile pictures  overall i am happy but i wish they would let you do a couple more things 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone users act rich and better than everyone else android users act like they got the better phone all the time
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in  years    apple    now you can get android on apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is literally  years behind 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,on the whole  my ideal smartphone would be ios on a samsung handset   that goes for macbooks too   id love to have macos on my hp laptop because i really dislike apple macbooks and their minimalist connections and second rate sound and finicky wifi 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,giving  apps  to apple when they dont support sideloading is peak brainwashing  downloading prop spyware on your phone is the only way to have an apple device  whereas you can de google an android and use f droid or other open source app stores that dont have spyware built in
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i will have to disagree with you on the ease of use  android should take that  and it should be a landslide too  let me tell you why  im a pro user  heavy user  high end user  whatever you wanna call it  i use no less than around  different apps with my daily driver phone  most of those are banking  smart home apps  from my smart devices and home electronics  etc  now one other app is dropbox   please try to read an email  where you get an official invoice or pdf document thats very important and you wanna save that to your dropbox directly  in a specific folder in your dropbox  where you have hundreds of thousands of files  organized each by their own folders  etc  please tell me  how many taps does it take  if you can make it  on the iphone  and how many on any android phone  yes  also talking about the entry level   devices as well   also  there is an app for one of my mobile phone providers  i use  of those at the same time in the same device  with physical sim cards  let that sink in  vodafone  orange  etc   and that app will show me my invoice  as a pdf being embedeed into a nice iframe in a webview app   thats a very respectable company app  right  they have the exactl same webview loading on both iphone and android  android knows thats a pdf document and gives me the option to save that file to my filesystem  let filesystem sink in a bit too   iphone  just displays a very crappy resolution pdf document in a very crappy little window with no options whatsoever   do you know how annoying that is  do you know which one is easier for me  to use   dont think you that in  years of life  i would know how to place a phone call icon on my smartphone screen   if youre giving that to the iphone  youre probably doing it to match the mentally challenged people and not the real smart  phone  users   love your stuff though by the way  just very aggravated about this one thing here    oh  and please share multiple photos combined with some documents from your downloads folder in your  filesystem  in an iphone   just how  easy  is that  do it while in an whatsapp conversation without exiting that conversation screen    its just  sad man  its sad 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think samsung is really close to launching their own version of imacs after seeing their m monitor and galaxy book laptops   it will be super interesting to get those   have never heard anyone on youtube discuss this 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,pixel support a lot of languages which iphone don’t  live translation etc…
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what if my tally was equal
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,que genial poder ver tu canal en español
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive been an android user since the beginning  but now that my main computer is a macbook pro ive been considering making the switch  however  all  of the apps i use for work are google apps  so im not really sure id see much of an upgrade in ease of use ecosystem  anyone have any opinions on this  looking for some advice 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive just been using android from the start so it will probably stay that way unless apple makes some insane value propositions
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,and this video was shot on iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im kind of person who want to avoid software update at all cost  the moment apple got sued for intentionally slowing down older iphone already traumatize me even as an android user 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android lost me at security  they may have gotten better over time but now i’m fully integrated into the apple ecosystem that it would be like a life style change at this point 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,youre brilliant
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i disagree with the fact iphones dont have bloatware i never use apple news  ibooks  homekit  or apple watch app  yet these and many more are pre loaded onto every modern iphone  at least you can uninstall them  but the phone should come installed with the bare minimum people actually need 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i switched to iphone for   security   privacy   updates
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the more setting i dont need the more time i need to find the settings i actualy need to change 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps goes to android  you can install apks and songs etc from internet unlike iphone  you can do way more with android than ios  overrall  android is the clear winner  ios is too restricted 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, if you respect yourself   android wins   if you want to pay to get  respect  from others   iphone wins 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the ecosystem analysis is rigged   the google  android  ecosystem is much better  more seamless and non discriminatory  how can a cult like ecosystem be better  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,honestly i find apple products so counter intuitive ill never buy one 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,love the green and blue background sides
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps goes for the ios  lmfao this is unbelievable  app store literally doesnt have one single music player app  even when you search for paid ones  that has at least   of the features  ui  customization and eq that for example poweramp on android has  and i could go on  because theres dozens of different apps in android that simply dont have substitutes when you switch to ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,theres no comparison  ios is literally  years behind android  dont believe it  just take the two phones and look at their notification management  ios todays notifications are equivalent to androids  notifications  ios is so far behind in a lot of essential things that to me it is just unbelievable at this point   and ios still doesnt have a real file manager and browser with support for desktop extensions lmfao 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,where the price  maybe more than half population in the world think that price is a deal breaker   money android  stars  lots of choice  lots of competition  so price is also competitive  apple  stars  monopolize all the way because no competitor  in other news of iphone   a woman said  she said she bought iphone for the color  if she likes the color she buy it  i just loled hard in otherhand android  most ppl fall into how much ram is it for majority of the time  ram equal fast  also loled hard ill surely buy iphone for socializing purpose  yknow  for bragging right  im an asian  you cant be poorer than your brothers and relatives 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont agree with some stuff  apple i find i look for answers for hours and figure out i am not allowed to do something i want because the apple cult system doesnt care what i want  yeah ease of use  as long as you dont care about what you want and deal with what apple  allows  you to do    ios i find the store reviews are way higher on the same apps  because it doesnt allow some reviews  the apps also suck or cost far more or dont even exist  also hate the way apple bills   apps way better in android   if you are not into a cult mentality android  iphone just wants to do things different so people cant do what they want    facetime = you can do video with people on a ton of apps   why apple ecosystem sucks is you have to use their stuff only   the  pill  on my phone has a great use cover the top of apps you are displaying   this one cracks me up  their lame lightning charging then i get a a good magsafe and apple watch charger plug goes in is a c plug lol so if i want to use just the cord instead of the whole charging unit i cant  that is some serious bs
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when discussing the ecosystem it would be remise not to cover all of the google apps  like gmail  drive  keep  meet  chat  photos  calendar etc etc  i dont think apple can hold a candle to android in this context especially for business use  so id personally tilt the ecosystem in googles favour 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, android won  in security and in everything except video recording and battery life
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot the  am i rich  factor
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is a shot review with bunch of lies just o male iphone look good
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,susge  i think we know the real winner is android   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  this has been guadalajaras debate
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,finally
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,most important criteria you left out was p r i c e 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,your comparing ios and one piece of hardware vs android and multiple hardware manufacturers  doesnt compare  once again  riding on apple coat tails for views
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why dont you show one of the most important things  a geekbench comparison— 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,just looking thru the comments on videos on this same topic  in which android won  it doesn’t matter what the creator picks as the winner  the android nerds be in the comments still giving more points on how android is better   all while we sit in simplicity with apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you should have considered cost efficiency and file manager in the parameters   apple products are way too expensive and you have to invest insane money for an apple ecosystem 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when i root my android its basically having all the infinity stones  want that latest android version  done  want ease of use  you can make that all happen  apps that apple will never support  done  custom lock screens and even enhancing your privacy  doneeee  iphone feels like im borrowing someone elses phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marques  you didnt mention side loading apps at all  android lets you load any app from any app store and ios only allows apps from the apple app store  i cant live without some of the foss apps available only for android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple versus the rest of world 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i own both an android  samsung  and an apple product  both has its pros and cons  but for me i like my samsung more 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video   i would have rated a tie on apps between iphone and android   the way i put it    is can you think of any app that is on iphone that is not on android  or if there is   is there an app equivalent    i would say yes   there is an equivalent   and youre not missing anything on either platform   the two oses are just such big big markets for apps there are no app holes in either ecosystem  it really is imo a tie   i agree with marques on his ecosystem comment   although   id almost say tie  like marques said the flexibility of the ecosystem goes to android  and samsung had an answer for almost everything in apples ecosystem to include airdrop    and i would say a slight ease of use advantage goes to apple  so depends on how you think of the ecosystem and what you care about  on who youd give the win on this one   really like the point of this video it really comes down to personal choice   my big reason for loving android is because of all the hardware choices and options you get with android   i love choice   lastly   marques made the comments that these were  objective  categories   most of them are not objective categories   they are subjective based on opinion   i think the only almost objective category was support  because you can measure that in years   but then also remember that iphones almost always get f grades in  repairability  so even that one is not that clear      again   great video   i like the balanced view  they really are both great mature mobile operating systems 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,just got an iphone as a work phone and the inability to just place an icon where i want it on the screen is mildly infuriating  also  iphones  are not just the simplest to use that is just whatever you get used to first  like how to power it off  its not the button that turns it on  other things apple people just know because they are used to it  but it was not obvious
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this video should have been titled  iphone vs  android  the real winner for you 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android and everything else is just a  junkie junkies brick 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,tried iphone for  years just hated it  very child friendly environment though i understand why most immature people love it    
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i broke my beloved galaxy s  ultra and my dad gave me his iphone  to use while i’m waiting for my phone to get fixed and i have to say i absolutely hate the iphone and i don’t know why people love them so much i legitimately think it’s because they’ve never tried an android  i’m also just not an apple person i don’t like their computers don’t like their os  i’ve always been on windows so that’s probably part of it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i met him
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ecosystem and design are the main reasons i cant even imagine leaving apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is ugly as   so you have to change it spoiler  you can‘t  ios just looks good per default  like the icons are soo mutch better on iphone  f e  the internet browser  on android ist a fucking saturn wich im pretty sure don’t have to do anything with wi fi of the phone app just looks way cleaner on iphone than on adroid 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the most important thing is blue text bubbles  when someone has the green text bubbles  i sorta look down at them and think they are less trustworthy second raters  like they are members of the  second tier  country club  losers  if you will 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,too bad you didnt include repairability  for me  this is the prime reason ill never buy an iphone as long as apple doesnt change their attitude towards this where every single module is software coded and locked to eachother for no reason 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,androiiiiiiiiiiiiiid

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would like to add privacy to those items
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this was an excellent video   thank you   i keep thinking about going to apple because i her the cameras are so great but i am an android girl  basically because thats what i started with   so for me  the ease of use on my android phones is well  very easy  i personally hate the apple interface and that is super important to me  i do have  ipads mainly for an app i cant get on android   i like being able to put the apps i use most often on page one of my desktop    i like just swiping up to get the main  back and hamburger   lines  to close apps buttons    i like that all m android devices from say   froward all use a usb c cord   unlike apple   but i keep hearing about that darn camera 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,rim vs disc hooked vs hookless tube bs tubeless
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hats off to you  marques  great video  for someone who has never seen a smartphone this would explain a lot and in a very clear way  for the rest   its indeed a summary of todays reality  on a market  your writers  should get a bonus on this one  greetings from ukraine 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i do like iphones for their cameras and looks  but what kills it is the settings menu  it literally makes me want to thrash it into pieces 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,former android guy here  at some point android customization started to be too much for me personally and i wanted that simple life lol  also i wanted the quick updates from a solid echo system because androids would never be updated  i miss android but the ecosystem that i have with mac overall being able to pass files from my mac to phone  or just go from one to the other is amazing 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont agree that apple on is easy to use and apps  android is a lot better  picture quality is not as good as android  microsoft excel is easier to use in android than apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,americans thinking that us matters more than the whole world  part 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  cool vid i agree with everything besides app  but the ans for this really depends on the individual n wat type of apps they need n as for updates many game get update or beta version on android first so it still depends on the app
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,respect  thats all i can say
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,can you make a video of how apple’s battery work as apple is a giant in the phone industry but battery is always something that i worry everyday when using iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love the design and build quality of iphones but i prefer android os  if i could have an iphone that ran android i would be the winner lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i appreciate that mkbhd can offer all his comparison videos between ios and android completely biased  but i would love to know in personal opinion  what his personal choice would be  dont go by newest   from say the inception of android and iphone  which would you go for
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple locks you in  love the fact i can root android shhh
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive always said android is the inventor and apple is the innovator  for the average joe an iphone is more than fine and for the more  techy  people who like to fidget get an android  worked for multiple cell phone carriers 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,totally biased 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i feel you are doing iphone vs samsung
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,biased
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,confused between iphone  pro max vs pixel fold    cant decided which one should i buy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i personally like ios more  i’ve used an s for a year  otherwise every iphone  because it is much more fluid and stable  there is no lag  closely integrated between hardware and software  extremely fast and responsive  tons of attention to detail
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung ecosystem = phone  tablet  computer  earbuds  cameras  tvs  speakers  surround sound systems  projectors  washers  dryers  refrigerator  etc 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you are completely wrong about apps  with android you can install any apk you want  that makes it an automatic winner 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is actually an awesome video and makes it a little easier to make a decision when buying a smartphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why people love iphone  because iphone control them by inability to take responsibility in their life 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,basically  the iphone is made for old people or people who dont like change  this also means that these people just continue to buy iphones just because  they just want a phone that does its job   the android is for people who like customisation and or control  they want their phone to work the way they want it to  they like having lights flash and colours glow when they get a message  they like things a certain way   i arrive at this conclusion from expirence  having started with android going to iphone for years for better battery and faster processing but then going back to android because of continuous icloud password requests  mail sync issues and bugs like song double ups and itunes not realising you already have a song downloaded  syncing to your next upgraded iphone   the iphone was easy to use  but its problems persist through upgrades  you find yourself getting an iphone so it just works but then going to android because the iphone annoys you  its a vicious circle 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the plant in the back looks like it floating
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,maybe you should consider file transfer ease  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,but yet no android has the camerabchin anymore
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,me when i still use the s
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i am missing the feature to set my alarm volume independent of messages   calls 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive come to prefer iphone  but i have nothing against android as ive used two samsung phones and both of them were great  i personally prioritize ease of use  look and feel  and apps  which are all things apple does great with their phones  im glad theyre getting better customization because that is the one thing i preferred about android phones 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone  end of story 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’d rather build a pc and keep my iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"i had to use an iphone as a company phone  i litteraly screemed after  mintues becuse i stuggeled with the some basic functions  i could not care about most of these points because im stuck on  why does my bluetooth turn on again automatically  why did my iphone highjacked my headphone in the middel of a meeting  i felt like an old fart who has no idea how to use a new piece of tehc altough it was just a stupid ass company phone   btw i had to lisen to people that ipohnes are the most beutiful artpice in the world  then i got one and it has ugly  very colorful but unharmonized look   to me the user expirience was just so painful that i dont care about apple and its products "
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my samsung has a back button  and a button that lets me bring up all things i have visited for hyper links kinda and a deleted button  or clear all  apple you have to swipe each one away
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think everyone know that both sides are just a mixed bag of tilts and compromises   this video is just click bait in a slow august news cycle   it shouldn’t be made  especially not by mkbhd
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,using the word objective is stretching its meaning quite a bit 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,root access 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive only used iphones for almost  years now  ill never switch 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android win
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you also care about gaming  android is definitely better than ios  because not all games can be played on ios and there are dedicated android phones for gaming 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i carry both and the android is used and touch more 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the bit about the apps is actually the other way around   android is king when it comes to apps   both quantity and quality   you have the playstore  third party app stores and the entire internet  lets not forget about ease of app installation   we are still waiting for official sideloading from apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,while android is obviously the better system  its true that what makes for the best phone choice is very subjective and personal  at the end of the day  ill spend my money on what i think is best for me and each person spending their own money should buy the best choice for them  hopefully  though  people will put some thought into what they choose 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its so classic  rich youtuber who gets everything for free  to forget about arguably the most important point  price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the answer is family  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this video so biased towards ios  i have used both iphone  pro max and currently using pixel   pixel  fars way better on multiple fronts than iphone  pm  ui experience is better on pixel phones than iphone  app usage is laggy on iphone  hate the app ui on iphone  very very difficult to use apps on iphone  the only plus point of ios over android is video camera    customization is way better on android   features are better on android   ease of use is again better on android than on ios  if its customizable then its easier to use thats the whole point of  customisation  idk how this dude gave rd point to ios    updates depend upon the company  premium phones offer   yrs    apps is a huge let down for iphones  the cost behind the in app purchases in ios is more then android  for ex on androjd youtube monthly premium costs  rs while on ios it costs  rs  app experience isnt that great on ios either  whatsapp ui sucks big time  same goes with imessage  the ui has been stagnant for ages on ios  used  iphones iphone pm and iphone   cant go back to ios now  there is absolutely nothing new on ios  apps lag on ios too  its not like ios is better than android on this front   another example is using credit cards on google pay app  on android you can pay via credit cards from google pay app but not on iphone  you cant even add credit cards on google pay app  the feature is disabled  costly in app purchases plus stupid app ui and lack of extra features on upi apps makes iphone less interesting     i am not sure i bought any smartphone out of excitement   ecosystem   may be in us and canada not in eastern hemisphere  android and windows anytime better than sturdy ui of ios    there is only one advantages of ios   video cam stabilization  thats it  it is leaps ahead of android  pixel  is my go to smartphone now  will buy pixel  pro just for the camera  the images are stunning and natural than the brighter pics on iphone which i hate   i thought of going for iphone every  yrs but later checked the pixel  pro with my friend and shifted to pixel  this march  this device is amazing  why should i pay  l when i can get all the things and some more things in around k   there is one device which i definitely recommend in ios   ipad 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video  im using an android since i stopped using iphone s  but i love macbook and ipad  one amazing thing on a samsung phone fo example  > fingerprint sensor below the screen  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,being able to install any apk i want is the only thing making me stick to android  if not for that i may have switched this year 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why would android ecosystem be limited to just samsungs  and not the fact that androids open source nature allows for a significantly larger variety 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me it’s apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lol most useless points went for iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i could never use an iphone cause i love customization and headphone jacks
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android win
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i worked at a particular company i won’t say because i technically can’t  however they definitely don’t want the users to make their phones look trashy  i’ll be honest…i agree with them  i see so many of the other companies phones where the users  so yes it’s not that company’s fault  have just made that companies phone look sh t…and that phone ultimately is an advert for the brand  sounds harsh  not that i care  but the average user can’t be trusted to not screw up their phone  every technician knows what i mean…the general public are terrible at using technology  and if they have an option which they can mess up… they will  they’re the same people who have ccleaner and  other ‘cleaning’ applications installed…all of which are running the non paid versions and it’s atrocious lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a huge category which you didnt even mention is the pricetag  i will never ever be willing to pay triple the price for something that has the same value as the cheaper product 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the definitive answer is this  if you live in the us and need imessage  get the iphone  if you love freedom and hate being dictated to about how to live your life  get a samsung  dont let american teenagers influence you to get into that apple prison 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,personally  i dont entirely agree with the apps category take  i think it depends on the apps you use  i use gmail  google maps and youtube a lot and those apps work great on my pixel  which i assume is because they are google apps  but i dont use instagram much and i know that is better on ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the problem is  that all the android flagships are so big size phones  bigger than   zoll    that’s actual the mean reason why i stay at apple   i had a pixel  this size wight was great 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,only reason i have an iphone is faceid  my fingers just don’t work with fingerprint readers and i get so irrationally angry when it doesn’t work lol 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android should be the winner in apps category imo  you can literally get any paid subscription based apps for free
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the personal categories is real  i’m all in on apple and i genuinely enjoy using their products  i really do not care about customization so my android friends rave about that but it has absolutely no draw for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thats actually a very good system to determine whats the winner 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i like structure  that’s why i have a iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple still fckin cant add the most important and basic features to ios… when you go to the keypad and tap some numbers  a sugestion of some contact will appear 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,eas of use ios  thats a joke  i can take any camera  tv  music player  any electronic device and k know where to look for any setting  any device but apple one  first device i had to google where to turn on something  some turn out to be unavailable  updates  another joke  i have updates for years for ios  but every next update makes the device slower and provides less things than for current sold device  plus those new things are available on other systems for years  apps  i got far less apps for ios  total number might be greater but i want local app  or some good weather app and its not available for ios  im not watching any longer  this video is a joke
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think the difference now is becoming very small   i’ve constantly switched from android to iphone for years and they both do what i need them to do  i happen to prefer iphone at the moment  it’s the little details that win me over 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,androids are for nerds for causal users iphone is best 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,after years of using android phones i got an iphone and didn’t hate it so i eventually gave in and got both  android for work and iphone for family friends same thing with laptops desktops and so on
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i had android for years  mainly a samsung galaxy s+  it was a good phone  i recently bought an iphone plus and regret it  now im waiting to get to the minimum payment of the iphone so that i can trade that in for an android phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i won’t assign the same value to the categories  the debate continues for me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,regarding the customization features found in android  id really be interested to see how much of the overall public actually take advantage of how deep android can be customized  most people around me just want a great phone with great basic features  sure  there will be the people that customize every aspect of a phone  but id wager most dont touch the extra features 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,please focus mode is in xiaomi phones 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  damn i miss that
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one important category is missing  budget   especially in india  iphone is so pricy  the above table holds good if you are in confusion to choose between flagship android   iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android all the way for me  theres lot of restriction when using ios  im usually get bored on same things after some times so using android i can customize a hell lot of things 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a weight scoring systems is aways dope
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, this is the worst kind of videos where youtuber has to somehow balance both sides and reach a non conclusive conclusion     also how does apple win in apps when it doesnt even support half things apps independently     also ease of use  if ease of use means the mobile not having anything  then easiest decision is to have a cheap android which doesnsame thing for  times lower price than apple phones   simply dont use a flagship phone as a basic mobile accessory and know that buying a   phone because its simple because it lacks things is stupid 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i can get every premium app for free on android that alone saves me hundreds of dollars a year  will never switch 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hola  soy usuario de android y me identifico con el primer punto la configuración  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,props for waiting until the middle to plug for like and subscribe instead of annoying everyone in the beginning   as someone who worked as a computer tech for a while  i had a gut feeling ease of use would go straight to iphone  because that concept was something i found annoying and limiting  inverse relationship with that and customization as you said   havent finished video yet  but i love the direction of this video  pointing out people will have different or subjective preferences or uses for their devices 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have an iphone just because of viruses  if android’s phones were just as safe as iphones i’d just go with android honestly  i hate how overpriced iphones are and not even having a charger in the box after spending € on a phone is just crazy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video but with the ease of use i don’t really get you take the arrangement of apps on a phone for a long time over the freedom of using bluetooth to send and receive files  pictures and apps or being able to download music and apps online without payments  come on bruh 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so says every apple freak
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,that’s a good system for deciding  definitely makes you think about what is personally important 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its not iphone vs android  its either iphone vs samsung  oneplus  xiaomi  etc  or ios vs android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,video request  could you compare the smart home strategies of apple and google  you always say to buy a product for the features it has now not for the ones that it will have  but ive been burned by google removing features from a product that i purchased 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i solved this debate a long time ago  people asking me what phone should they buy   iphone  people knowing what they want would buy that  and me apple yes  but stocks  phone anything but apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use should have been given to android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is one of the silliest reviews that ive ever watched  apple devotees  take note  this  like many other tons of other reviews over the internet are just a facad  its one of those videos where the author gives his her impression and strong bias opinion over apple products and using such terms as less quantity over quality to upsell apple products and its not surprisingly that in such reviews apple products and to be concise iphones in particular ends up to be the winner  its laughable indeed to see  marques on   scoring high on apples iphone and opines that he uses android phone as his main and cites that apples ecosystem scores high over other products its insane to come and think of it  every manufacturers have their own ecosystem and it varies hugely but to use this as a yardstick of measurement is arguably silly and laughable and to top it all  apple devotees are paying up premium over features that are decade old in other platforms  any android phone with the price range of   or less   comes with usb c port fast charging  gb ram  mp camera and a gb rom  as base model  something you can never find in the apple ecosystem at this price points   marques  its laughable and silly to justify your claims and contrast that iphone is better than an android  especially when the products base model comes at   how about you factor in affordability when doing such reviews 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the  price  category is missing 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about sar
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i prefer android because of the price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i subscribed because i love the sound and tone of ur voice  i also like how honest and laid back you seem  im looking to buy a new android with a bang ass camera and descent display  needs a headphone jack  im not going over   clueless to which brand i should use 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,since i have both android and ios device  i can summarize it for you in few words  android is good as long you dont turn on the internet  because once you decide to use it for real  you will get tons of adds even inside your gallery  i mean wtf  what is this shitty system that are so fucking annoying  it has good features but not worth the headache you will get from adds 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great comparison  as always  but no mention of security or privacy as categories  including in any of the comments that i can see  perhaps its because im getting old but theyre definately important considerations for me  based just on the differences in the business models   android is produced by a company whos business model is to give most stuff away for free but collect and monetize as much personal information as they possibly can  whereas ios is produced a product company that makes their money by charging  quite a lot  for products and doesnt make money from advertising  apple should completely own privacy but it would be interesting to hear your view 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you missed the fairphone in the update game   they promise approximately  years of support as well
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why nobody talks about security 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,fair enough  however  ive been using iphone for half a year and that time showed to me  that system is not not for me  just quick example m²  apps never ios  though i miss so good and longtime updates 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, objectively  another apple commercial 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you should compare availability in cars   i e  carplay vs  android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video  very accurate for 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,broi… i need a iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,broi… i need a iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android like duh
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,about that excitement category i have to say one diferent aspect of it  you sad android is more exciting because there is more going on  and its true that there is more going on on android side  but that doesnt apply to android users because they dont get any new features on their phones  its only once in couple of years when you get new android phone that you get some new features and later on its the same phone with nothing new coming to him and that is boring  but on the iphone on the other hand its much more exciting because you get new features with every new version of ios  and you get the feel every time like you just got new phone all together  so it newer gets boring  and you always wander what new features will come next time   also on android phone people dont even know what hidden features they have because they keep changing with every new phone  but on iphone people know about its features and are using them  because you continue to use ios with every new iphone you upgrade to  and so you get to know it much better and deeper over the years   android is the best thing that happened since smartphones came to be  because its basically freedom  unlike apples ios is  but if we want to improve it we need to know what is not so good about it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i was team green for years  and about  years ago switched to the dark side  is it still the dark side   now my family and i are everything apple and there is no going back 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,his content is such high quality  easily one of the greatest yt channels
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro when are you doing what what i think about samsung video its been  years
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what happened to his hand at   lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this topic has become almost as controversial as the towers  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when you buy an iphone  you dont own the iphone  the iphone owns you 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,customization wise  i see apple as if they’re a school uniform and android would be just wearing your favorite outfit
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well  for me   costumization   use it a lot  features   like to explore  ease of use    like complex things  updates   like changes  apps   like before i like exploring  excitement   i like phones  ecosystem    not in the us   well  i dont really use anything else other than airpods with my phone   when i calculate  the winner looks like is android  but i use both since i keep  phones  and as long as they provide me with what i need  theres no winner 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is just so boring now
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,updates you say  my a s running android   custom roms are a huge advantage that android has over iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,to be honest ecosystem should go to both because samsungs ecosystem works worlds better than apples
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,most of my family uses iphones  ive owned both  and iphone is alrightt  works well  dont think about it  but every time i get one  i end up missing my android phone  while when i have an android phone  usually ive owned samsung  though not exclusively  i dont miss many things about the iphone  maybe an app or two  but not as much as when i miss the android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you just make your app dynamic then it shouldnt be an issue 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,itd be hilarious if you did this for tablets  android cant even compete lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me  ecosystem continuity  services apps updates ease of use features  customer service customization  excitement
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thats the only reason samsung is big bc the places where they sell more is where people dont have the services for the iphone like we do in the us
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,loved that db cover on your phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i like both but prefer android  usa mostly is super brainwashed that if it is not an iphone it is not good 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps better on ios   whenever i wanted to install an app on an iphone i couldnt  there are so much more apps available for android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the best android over iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is available on numerous smartphone brands  whereas ios is exclusive to iphones  therefore  comparing an operating system like android  which is accessible on a variety of smartphone brands  with ios  which is limited to apples iphones  may not be a fair comparison  its akin to comparing open source software with closed source software 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,isnt it should be ios vs android  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i believe the real winner is the side that has a larger demographic of people owning the product android is still ahead on that demographic so until apple decides to make cheaper phones the android side will still be larger
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as a hoppy app developer who just makes apps to make life easier  the android wins for me  i can create apps and share them with friends and family easily  free of charge  on ios you will need a developer license  which is not free  you need a mac to even deploy the app  and the phones you want to deploy to needs to be registered as developer phones 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,excitement would go to iphone too since features aren’t exciting until they get on iphones lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i once bought an android phone that required to download the phone app before you make a call  no definitely
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,worst thing about the new iphones is they absolutely suck for cell service  my iphone  was awesome  my  pro is terrible  i live in a rural area and service is always a problem but this is terrible  i even took it back and got a new sim card put in  i warned a family member not to get a  pro but he did and he’s regretting it  it just will not stay connected to lte  switches to g all the time and then i can’t use it
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphones stay the same with minor updates or upgrades once a year  ios  isn’t all that can’t change the fonts still  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think apple is the  social  choice  in college i was the only person with an android phone in my whole class  that was way more isolating than youd expect  folks would facetime eachother and play imessage games and that was just how they communicated  this was exacerbated by covid but still  im still android though for now at least  since college and since pixels have taken off  ive seen far more androids out and about
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,damn the music
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,performance would go to apple  too 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,include apk  for apps then android wins
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is waaay easier to use than iphone and more thought out i just switched and wow  what a difference 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bias
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dude  i am using android  on a  year old phone  you cant restrict the update ability to only official updates 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i couldn’t make the choice  so i use a galaxy s and an iphone  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there are problems with this comparison as per its current title  the first of which is if comparing oss the title should be ios vs android as iphone isnt an os its a device name  then if just comparing the oss then ecosystem is an invalid comparison as an ecosystem has nothing to do with the os  its entirely a company thing  as demonstrated by the fact that samsung also has an ecosystem now  the fact is that while its true that ios is apple and vice versa  that conflation needs to be separated in any fair and honest comparison  i e you either do a apple vs samsung comparison  where ecosystem as a comparison becomes valid  or you do an ios vs android comparison  where ecosystem isnt a valid comparitor   im also not convinced by the continuity argument with respect to ease of use  as continuity is just that and has nothing to do with ease of use  an os could have a rigid inflexible and horrendously difficult to use ui and be unchanging across  major os updates and thus have continuity but have very poor ease of use  so the fact that ios has remained essentially an unchanged ui over generations is not an ease of use plus point  its a ui continuity plus point nothing more  on the flip side  the configurablity of an os is not a negative for ease of use  an os can be very configurable and still remain simple to use  if its natively got a simple ui then the fact that it can be configured to have an horrendous ui does not negate that in  stock native  form its an easy to use ui  given that both ios and android use icon based uis with a multitude of pages and apps  then they are inherently identical when it comes to  ease of use  in fact you can justifiably argue that an os with an infinitely configurable ui can be easy to use by everyone  as it could theoretically be configured to suit every individuals needs with respect to  ease of use  anyway ease of use always comes down to familiarity  there simply is no such thing as  objectively easier to use  when it comes to comparing two os with similar levels of complexity  of course a feature lean  low functionality os ui will have an inherent advantage with ease of use as theres simply less ways to use it  apple product users will always argue that windows is less intuitive and harder to use than apples os  but windows users will say the same about apples os  the very fact that windows  or android  users do not wholesale agree that apples oss are easier to use is all the proof needed to completely negate the apple os is easier to use argument  if it were  everyone would agree it to be the case 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ymmv on preferences for excitement etc  but  the apple ecosystem works for me mac iphone ipad atv 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i owned both android and iphone since  years ago   years ago  i barely touch android because its lags  lack of ease of use  but now  most of the time my hand tends to hold android  even if it doesnt get any update anymore  stuck at android   but the features  ease of use  customization  multitask  it really smooth and run along with my needs 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is better  dislike unfollow xd
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i had twice an android phone and often minor issues  then i switched to iphone and everything is working for the last  years  i do not know how to explain but with iphone i feel you get an harmonic system and support  and it was   reliable so far and i trust apple with data security more than other providers  these points are all that matter to me and that‘s why i stick to apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why not android vs ios rather android vs iphone  if we are going to discuss softwares and features   thumbnail shows a pixel device and an iphone  yet the discussion is not about the devices but rather about the software features   good video anyways 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot the affordability category  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,configuration should be two points  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i disagree there are categories missing and this analysis is flawed  given a chance i could do a better comparison  also i think when you make such videos  dont concentrate on the american market  the usa is a small portion of the world    even the flagship android cannot be a google pixel  are you paid by google    and there is absolutely no way home phone iphone can stand against all three other rest  this just reminds me of the time you and some creatives were involved in a youtube rewind   catching the same vibes marques 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  wise
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’m neurodivergent    owning an android for so many years honestly got tiring  i’m naturally inclined to hyperfocus   fixate on every possible customization thing i can  so honestly  it got to be stressful on android  the simplicity of ios has been the most relaxing way to interact with a device  personally   then i pieced together the ecosystem   i haven’t needed to leave it   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, million apps to  million apps and it goes to iphone  lmao 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lets agree android wins 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android upsets so much with their updates and i was a diehard android user but i switched and i switched because apple doesn’t promise shit and don’t hold up their side of the bargain and you know where apple is going with their updates whereas androids updates don’t change shit   therefore i will remain team apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video but i would have mentioned android apps like one hand operation+  quick cursor  micro gesture  apps that completely change how you use your phone    not mentioning new pipe  torrents and modded apps for reasons 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i know that with modern smartphones its probably not much of an issue anymore  but i would have definitely been in the android camp as a teen young adult  i was all about customization and fiddling with shit  but as i got into my early twenties  i started getting sick of redoing all of my customizations every time i needed to reformat and reinstall my computer  or installed a new os and struggled to get things back to the way they were   i also used to use a fully custom key configuration when playing games  but constant reinstalls and constant reconfiguration made me sick of doing it all  so i basically just said  screw it  to all of that and just started using standard configurations  standard  ootb windows with no fancy crap  wasd controls  which thankfully became standard  standard everything  which is why i really value the simplicity of ios    sure  sometimes i look at android things and say  thats pretty cool  but then i flash back to the olden days of fiddling with things for hours to get it _just right_ and i realize why ios is right for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i used to be on the android side but switched to apple a few years ago and now feel like i’m too deep in the ecosystem to ever go back  what with an ipad pro  macbook pro  airpods  airtags  how could i ever go back android even if i wanted too 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me  price of new phone and costs involved in repair and upgrade is an important category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,sellout
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,amazing video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,never ever will i buy an iphone  i cant support a company that takes away ports on their computers only to sell it back to them  they then do the same with the power bricks on their phones
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple customer service sucks 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont like apple anyhow  but on the homescreen i dont like that i cant put my apps where i want them to be 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me the money is the most important factor so 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the iphone is definitely for people who barely use their phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as an iphone user what i miss about android is the ability to do…… whatever the hell i wanted but there’s just something about iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,both sucks  i wish phones were as open as desktop computers 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the both have pros and cons  its all just what is important to you 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use id have to give android only because the way you have to close out app tabs and even just close out an app is so excessive and unnecessary  android makes it simple you choose the apple style or you can have buttons at the bottom of the screen which is leagues easier than relearning the apple way
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,loved this 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,gotta disagree on the apps part  mainly because apk files exist and are super easy for android and are not possible for ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marques  i believe you failed to mentioned  very important things for iphone users     d face id or the notch for the non believers     the ability to unlock the phone seamlessly  with higher security than fingerprint that works even in the dark  the system even learns to recognize the changes we make along like growing beard  special makeup  etc     the vast processing power  it allows us  or at least myself  to use the same iphone for  years or more  always updated  without feeling it slow  without feeling any need to replace it  other than the desire to get a  new toy   which i resist  because these things are expensive  many android friends say iphones are too expensive  but they spend more money on their android devices over extended periods of time than me     the superior os optimization    on ios we can have literally dozens of apps opened in the background because we dont feel any weight or performance degradation from them  just for the purpose of this example  ive just counted how many i had at the moment and counted  opened apps  ios memory management is way more advanced   contrary to android  ios is almost maintenance free  do i need all these apps opened  of course not  but because they dont affect the performance  i simply forget to close them   also  i rarely cold boot an ios device to fix any issue because theyre almost non existent  maybe once or twice a year  can you say the same of any android smartphone     very good battery life  also because of the ios better optimization for its hardware  all iphones  except for the se of course  have good battery life  thats also why fast charging is not such a big deal in the iphone world  speaking for myself  i left home in the morning at   its past midnight at the time of this posting and it still shows   battery remaining in my one year old iphone and my most used app is usually youtube 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,can you review itel phones   plsss   idk how they can get so cheap
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i want to see samsung vs iphone  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what i would like to see  is a way to optimize storage on the iphone  without having to pay out the cazzo 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for ecosystem is iphone  for everything else android phones
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,literally only on apple for the imessage
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,usb c comment didnt age well after just  weeks lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ill never consider an iphone until they arent  years behind on notch design
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,might wanna double check that  focus mode  been on pixel for a few years 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think for ease of use  the real winner is whatever their  tech support  is familiar with  and by  tech support  i do not mean the companys employees  i mean whoever their goto tech person is in their social circle  i use android  my grandmother also uses an android  she regularly asks me how to do things on her phone  but if she had an iphone  shed likely still have to ask me  the main difference is then id have to learn the answer before i could show her due to not using an iphone myself and not being nearly as familiar with it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i personally am a apple user and will stay as an apple user for the foreseeable future  for me it’s really the ecosystem that makes me love apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i honestly dont wanna be stuck in apple eco system  thats it thats all   id like to buy my wife a product that isnt apple for iphone and it just fully working with all its features but i cant 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,actually both of them are great  i have mix of both ecosystems and i’ve never chosen one because of the brand name… i find ios better at simplicity  fluidity and look  while i find android better at productivity  if you want to be productive using ios just switch to mac os… android is so good regarding its file management and that you can open multiple windows at once  while ejecting a hard drive from ios or ipados could damage it… i still find my galaxy better than my ipad regarding support for external devices  dex feature which i wish that apple implements a similar feature on its ipados at least… on the other hand i wish that android would get better app quality sometimes  i would also suggest android to add simple mode for users who want simple user experience 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"you did not add the most important thing to the list  the cost can everyone buy an iphone everywhere in the world  answer  no does apple have stores in every country in the world  especially the middle east or eastern european countries  answer  no are apple products reasonable in pricing  answer  no cost  cost  cost  my friend an egyptian muslim passed through here"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the real winner is  you  to enjoy the features they have to offer  whatever you use
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,another waste of time ideo 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the winner is the friends we made along the way 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,very nicely put 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im waiting for the pixel  review  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me  apple has removed the joy   i use apple for work and sony android for home  the apple is great for updates and it just slick   the android is more fun and interesting  i feel like i dont own the apple  its a work phone so i dont really  because it is so limited in customisation and personalisation  but then i have had a samsung in the past and it is so full of bloatware i cannot delete  my preference is android  i really dont like the lockdown of apple and i dont like the menu structure  the apple screen is really nice and battery life is excellent 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how about software security and battery performance 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think someone who is using a  gen old phone is not really using it to its full potential  mostly phonecalls or messages  so i dont really think its a big argument to talk about older genereration phone updates  when youre trying to figure out whats the better option for an ultimate flagship 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,yo im blind and deaf how come you did not talk about actual ease of use
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,not to mention you have access to developer mode
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the calculator on the iphone is pants compared to the samsung 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,do you think in the future both systems will reach a stagnant period where the gap between both is just as little by copying features from each other or they will grow apart 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,maybe this video was mostly meant for audience in the us  but in other parts  affordability is the first shot in the foot  which is not compared here 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as a software developer i find it easier to ship updates to android faster than to ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the camera and that ease of use bullshit is why i bought my iphone  pro max  it’s not easier to use than any high end android  more options can clutter the screen or they can be hidden neatly for the few who wants them  so if you need to change something about how you use your phone  you can  but if you want to use your iphone in a way that better suits you  you are fucked  just because something doesn’t have options doesn’t mean it’s easier to use and there are soo many quality of life things ios is missing  android sucks ass too btw it just sucks less ass than ios  i wish someone made a good os  the camera is good though
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a lot of gimbal apps only give you full features on the iphone  otherwise an android user  for the sd card mainly 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think for me its ease of use and customization and i think apple has that dialed in to perfection  i have apple care on my devices so repairability is never an issue for me  the only thing i hated on the iphone was the charger  glad they are finally going with usb c 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,just a quick question why allways rich and celebrity’s always use i phones   lite almost everyone why  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the only thing that draws me to iphone forever is optimisation  comparing the same features  the iphone version is always faster  easier to use and less problematic    i don’t think android will ever win in this category because of how broad the device options will always be 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the reason i switched back to android from iphone was cuz i couldnt get the  super n niche  apps that i liked from android  sometimes communities make better apps then original developers  you usually dont get that from apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,to be honest  i used android from  to  until i just felt it was slow  even if its old it should have worked quickly like people would say  even if there is much compatibility and bias  i changed to apple later  cant say how fast the phone became  even if the battery is fast to drop im still happy that i get to switch from  fps blockmine gameplay to  fps minecraft gameplay 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the only reason i wont switch to android google for a phone is that i like going into the apple store and genius bar for tech support right at my disposal  and green text bubble but i can get over that lol 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  i have never heard of any game developer with a game on both platforms saying   we will be giving an ios update first 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im not dating anyone with out blue bubbles 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,blue bubble go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so basically this isnt ios vs android but apples iphone vs general company making a phone using android  and well using a foldable for aspect ratio problems was just funny arent those still on the earlier stages  and well does ios even support any foldables at all like idk didnt seem fair that youre using diff phones for android and ios well ofc itll win that way not a fair comparison at all ive got a  year old android phone  op   and its still pretty great  a fair comparison wouldve been if u used a certain company from androids category  seems unfair in that regard cuz android would have won   more categories easily if u chose the right company rather than a general product
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marquez   its up to you   me  nah its up to you  gonna follow your preferences  xd
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i used to like blackberry   and still say that both apple and android have not finished stealing all of bbs features  that was years ago  then i was for lg because of price  camera  features and removable battery  and even laughed at samsung  now that there really are no real alternatives to samsung  i got me an s ultra with  ram which i keep filling up with photos  i guess it is an evolving thing for me  and even though i have  iphone users at home  i will never be an iphone user  it feels like a limited phone that erks me  im a hobby pc builder and love customization 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive had every android flagship for a decade  and one iphone  pro max  i currently have an su and i cant wait to get my hands on a  pro max and put this clunky curved edge bullshit out  iphones just work  so much more polished  face unlock  so fast  making transactions with my face  super fast  finger print scanner under the screen  complete bs  put it on the side where i can feel it  pull it out of my pocket and its at the home screen ready to go even in the dark  my su is horrible with face unlock  blah blah
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,idk as a current iphone  pro max user i really am envious of samsungs dex mode and periscope camera
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no  hide my email is completely free  you dont even need a phone iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,also  iwatch is shit for all the people who want a watch in circular form factor i would anyday go for garmin or any other giving me a circular one moreover mac haha a laptop that cant show iphone files on it over wire man i am trying to get over the apple ecosystem as soon possible only ipad is something keeping me there 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,again on point   many do prioritize for android too and with half the app not available on ios i dont think ios stand a chance 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,on third point  i dont agree  if i can customize for my ease the phone which is more customizable should be the one who wins its clearly android for rd point from my pov 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,already  k reactions so you will probably won’t read mine  however i don’t think that you don’t take into account the apple ecosystem when you have a family  what’s up with that 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,simple…iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,perfect video along with that  what categories companies are implementing in their phones  long time ago  soooo helpful for tech enthusiast
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you want latest features and gadgets  samsung  you want a smartphone with only time tested and good features  with good specs and no hassle  iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i had android for a few years    back to iphone and could not be happier
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  whats the point of a hardware that cant handle the newer os updates  + dont forget that apple admit its slowing down the older ones  so i guess its tie if not lose
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android wins hands down for freedom but samsung kills it with dex
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,from user’s perspective  customization   android features   android  apps   apple   many fraud apps ain’t there on iphone and apps seem pleasant on iphones   no bloat ware on iphone  updates   apple ease of use   android  because it’s easier to kill all apps at once instead of swiping one at a time and the notifications and settings can be seen all together when you drag down in android instead of apple having it left   right of the notch  ecosystem  apple as mentioned it is smooth and seamless experience
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,watching this on my pixel which i use   of the time over my iphone  i only use my iphone when im charging my pixel and for photo videoshoots  since i use an older model of pixel  the only downside of pixel for me is  its not readily available in my country but im planning to upgrade to a newer pixel soon  i guess it all comes down to preference  but pixel  android  for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,interesting that for ecosystem you mentioned samsung for android as a rival for appple  but not the google ecosystem in general  gmail  password managers  android tv syncing with your account  logging in to other ecosystems with the google account  plus all the smart home accessories 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,excitement android  lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,please do a review of harmony os 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i took a risk with my current phone and went with the oppo find x pro  the convenience of the super fast charging alone is enough to put me off wanting to go back to try the  main brands samsung  google or apple  camera is also great  definitely interesting what matters to different people 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,of course typical political answer as usual lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you just lost my respect   android has more when it comes to the features of android and then the thing youre forgetting about is android allows a multitude of different hardware phones and each hardware can do its also own thing so youre missing out completely youve voided your whole argument in my opinion this whole video after a minute and a half dont even matter to me because you missed the main parts of the first part
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,fun comparison  and very personal of course  for me support security is very important  but i go with android for the ecosystem  yes  apples ecosystem is better integrated  but also very restrictive  if you put open to third parties above integration android wins ecosystems hands down   another point i missed was costs  when you go mid range  apple can barely keep up  low range they are missing altogether  yes  the apple watch has the best sensors  but they are way too expensive   so here i am  with a cheap phone  cheap smart watch and an incredibly cheap chromebook  and yes  i need to replace my phone early  but hey  ive got the savings to spend and i can do all i want to do 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,imagine saying software updates are better on iphone when you know with each update they make your device slower with the sole purpose of you having to buy the newer phone to have a better experience again  what a cult apple users are 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,security and privacy not a category in  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i agree that official updates support goes easily to apple  but how about unofficial  there are lot of community behind older android phones in form of custom roms  it is quite fragmented but it is there  there is no similar thing for apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i miss a lot of important aspects  which makes android much more attractive  and i want to buy an iphone badly     price range  begins much cheaper     always on display     multi screen apps at the same time     faster charging     unlocking with face and finger     app drawer  keeps the home screens much cleaner     side bar     usage of other accessoires with phone  why cant i use a watch by choise with iphone  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,imessage is still a dealbreaker for me that keeps me on ios  i’m shocked more people don’t see it that way  i’ve used android for extended periods of time  and although i enjoy playing with its customization  it falls short as a communication tool for me  being the only person in my social circle with an android makes it difficult for everyone else if i’m in a group chat with friends  or maybe a new group chat planning a specific event  my phone will always be a communication device before it’s ever a toy  and for me the iphone still does that better 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,additional ecosystem things that should be compared too is privacy and security
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i mean the most important aspect is actually missing  price  especially price performance  you get way more bang for your buck on android  i cant see how the iphone that hasnt barely changed for  years can even compete  the new  features  are actually a joke  you get video audio erasers  sharpeners  foldable phones  thermometers and what not on android phones and also every new innovative software features are on android first while the iphones look the same and dont come up with really new stuff for eternities  its all good and solid plus easy to use and ecosystem is great but thats about it  the ridiculous price also says the same  its about time for innovations 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what does mkbhd stand for 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,leaving out security makes no sense to me  and influences me far more than the feature list you use  which phone os is more vulnerable to hacking  get real marques  how could leave security off the list  how about the rate of updates  the actual time it takes to get an update out  how about how long the phone stays viable  how long and at what rate the value and function lasts   what is the resale value of the used phone  how many android phone are junk in three years  lacking significant updates  you are comparing the top of the line android devices  in general  if you include all android devices they will compare much worse  junk android phones are unlimited  the plethora of junk apps on android is the same 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,me  he’s spitting facts
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,common apple w
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i like iphone for privacy features  ease of use  updates  apple music  car play  cpu speed and apple wallet  i also like the excellent hardware quality  for myself and family  ive purchased  iphones and none ever broke or had issues 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro what are you talking about with each of use not being the most important thing in your day to day  thats legit the most important thing
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this issue is the same as lot of other issues in our life  ev vs ice  ps vs pc  etc  there is no perfect one for everyone  each person has a set of priorities  preferences and skills  i own both iphone and android phones  a latin america thing  being that i am older  i tend to prefer iphone for most of my important things  work  automation  chats  etc  it just works  every time  without fail   i use the android for a secondary phone line  and have tried it as a backup for automation  it tends to fail more than the iphone  for most works it does fine  but there were instances where the phone just froze or could not figure it out what was wrong  i have younger coworkers that swear by android  they love making their phone unique  customized lockscreen  etc  and i get it  i just don´t have the patience to figure out what went wrong when it goes wrong  i have to admit  having a phone mimic jarvis from iron man is cool  but i use the phone mostly for work  would not give up consistency over coolness 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a video to show how marques have inside info on apple  guess   the new stuff em  hahaha
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the answer is iphone just saying 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,updates  ease of use  apps  features  customization  excitement  ecosystem   iphone    android     whos agreeing lol  all my life i prefered android over iphone but recently i bought iphone  pro and not regret it  yes  there has been some minor issues cause i needed to relearn how to so some things but over time its ok 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i get that reviewers cant really endorse this  but talking about android without mentioning sideloading and community mods doesnt really make sense  i could never switch to to iphone just because of this  i havent seen a yt ad in years thanks to the modded version of youtube  paying nothing  ive upgraded my   phones camera  so much with the modded gcam at the point that people with iphones ask me to take photos  in general having access to github creations allows you to do so much more  sticking to intended features leaves so much on the table that it really doesnt make sense anymore as a comparison 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,at least in australia  the iphone still cannot connect to our public transport system to replace physical cards  im in melbourne where we have myki and havent had a physical card in years  my partner has an iphone and needs to carry a wallet just so she can use public transport  app feature hardware that means i wont be swapping for a long time
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lol   mkbhd just mentioned all the new features of the new iphone   weeks prior…  xd  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,another thing have to face it absolutely it doesn’t make it bad  but android is a  cookie cutter  operating system that several different phone manufacturers use a lot like windows  apple‘s phones and computers  etc  apple makes the hardware and the software and there’s definitely something to be said for that 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as always  the video is excellent  but i do have to say i’m pretty surprised that  especially these days security was not a factor in your evaluations between the two different systems
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,another great video and great way to compare the two without taking a completely biased side  always enjoy your videos  appreciate what you bring to the table and teach all of us with 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how about rhe update from ios makes your iphone slower 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hey marques  love the videos  i remember when i had an iphone    can’t recall  and i thought i’ll have a change and went for the sony experia z way back  i think it was one of the first waterproof phones   i thought it was a nice phone  but i couldn’t get on with the os at the time  so ended up buying an iphone s halfway through my contract and i’ve had iphones since   but i do like the look of some of the samsung phones they are nice looking phones but i have preordered an iphone  pro  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i just want the android to support airdrop and have better video   i love everything else
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what happened to mkbhd video design  what are all these crazy colors and fonts   did your designer die or something 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,shall i switch from android to iphone  will be  there any difficulty while handling 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"  this video compares customization options between iphone and android    android offers more customization and features compared to iphone  making it the winner in terms of features    comparison of android and apple phones in terms of software and apps    apples ecosystem has a slight edge over samsungs due to its ease of use and seamlessness  recap by tammy ai"
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro sent the value for money category flying right out of the window didnt he  p does the viewer even know by watching this video how costly it is to own an iphone for all the pros this video shows over an android  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,remember when iphone  updates  deliberately slowed down earlier models  that was just criminal 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,funny how its iphone vs android  the one man army 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,but when it comes to updates  apple wins over everything else android there are also more categories where android wins  the most important point is  for example  manufacturer independence 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im actually considering iphone  weird since im all for the open source stuff and repairability and everything  but  well  what i want from my phone is for it to function as a phone  a good camera is a plus  so yea might as well dip my toes into the apple ecosystem while im at it  aaaand that is why im binging phone reviews  need to find one that fits my bill  not sure what i go for  but need to find out  fast  before that crack caused black spot spreads over large enough area that i cant use this phone anymore  yep swapped the screen already  im surprised how easy it was and that xiaomi had an official guide on doing it  ended up dropping a hammer on it the next day and the screen protector wasnt enough  so yea  a good screen protector is also a must  i should probably invest a large amount of the phone budget on otterbox or similar  supcase seems nice too 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,these reviews have become as stale as new phones stale in innovation  dont get me wrong  phones have come a long way but theres no excitement in the ohone spanlce anymore 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why price is not a category when you can have  google pixels for the price of a single iphone  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,very surprising to see  ease of use  going to apple  without even being mentioned that it can be extremely subjective based on the region  like in most part of asia  android is de facto and apple still remains an aspirational product  now although the sales are growing that ever before  but id say  ease of use  can be derived from if someone whos never used a smart phone  which would they find easier to adapt to  and here  hands down its android  ive had my grandparents  and many elderly giving their iphone up for much cheaper android phone just for their ease of use and simplicity  marques  ive been an avid follower for so long  this was unfortunate to see 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so basically the clear winner is android   right  android is the winner  i already knew from the beginning android is always at the top  thank god android is still number   as a low budget smartphone user  android is always with me  and iphone sucks
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i also have two phones iphone  mini and iphone  pro max
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the title makes no sense  you cant compare  iphone  against  android  the former is a phone  a physical device  the latter is an operating system  the proper title would be  ios vs android  or in the case of comparing devices   iphone vs [insert an android phone here] 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’ve lost friends over this topic haha   nicely done    one thing i’ve noticed as i’ve aged is the excitement factor  new tech  and customization used to be very high on my list and now are very low  i can figure out most things tech but i just don’t care like i used to  so i just go apple for their build quality  ease of use  and stay in apple ecosystem for things like imac   airpods  and you mentioned imessage and facetime which is nice when wanting to video your parents who are +   it’s easier 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,whats the android phone hes using in this vid  it looks really cool
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive vacillated between both   im currently running a samsung s  but thinking about going back to apple   there were little things my iphone s plus did that none of my androids have  like knowing when im in the car and automatically activating bluetooth   with my samsung  if i dont remember to do it  it doesnt happen   and even when i do remember to do it  its slow about it   apple also has really solid end to end encryption for privacy  whereas android will essentially roll over hand your info to anybody who asks for it    ive also had more glitchy apps on android than with apple   it was easier to understand what people were saying on a phone call with the apple  maybe because of better speaker hardware     android is kind of the wild country ecosystem   theres a lot going on  not all of it good  not all of it bad  and not all of it works properly  but its damned interesting   apple is kind of the castle ecosystem   everything is reassuring and safe   everything works the way it should   there are rules  and everybody follows them  like it or not   and when something is proven to be a good idea in the android world  itll someday make it to apple when its polished and shiny enough   an apple device has manners and is never messy  unlike those  other  phones     foldable phones have really grabbed my attention of late  and im really interested to see the one+ open when it comes out  but the foldable market is in its infancy and not everything works well    so  for the money  im thinking of maybe going with apple again  even though the  really hasnt changed much from the   aside from usb c   maybe it would be an easier decision if these phones werent so damned expensive nowadays 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot one massive edge to android  price points  you can get an android phone for  bucks and the variety is vast compared to iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you inspire me so much  thanks for the video marquin 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,but when your old iphone gets the new update it gets slower  and slower 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about price  he didnt even mention that 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,look  ill be honest  i bought the iphone  mini to see what all the hype is about   was quite disappointed  maybe its because i come from an actual android background   im spoiled for that  i mean  we got customization out of the box  which means cleaning cache  using uad  universal android debloater  to remove bloatware  root access to modify ram   rom  split screen technology to multi task instead of exiting apps  rd party app repositories to get more space for internal memory  and a plethora of brand options with different price points  apple is pretty basic much like a glock out of the box whereas android is like a sniper rifle  the only good feature for me on apple was garageband because im a musician   if you have an idea for a good groove  you can do quick recording   implement other instruments to aid you in the process  theres also their software updates apart from my previous addition  at the end of the day  whoever is choosing what product is highly subjective  i mean how long did it take apple to get pip  picture in picture 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,like how apples repair service works  i mean its so great 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one of the biggest features i miss about android that i wish was on ios is multitasking multi window and pop out window support  there are so many times where i’m using two apps at the same time and keep flipping back and forth between them and it would be so much easier and more efficient if i could just have one app on the top screen and the other app on the bottom screen  apple please add this
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wasted my  minutes  knew the answers already  so did the conclusion  same talks since   i think phone tech and these techtubers have reached saturation  funny thing is youtube algorithm doesn’t suggest me these anymore   suggested me this as i searched for iphone  launch 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about environmental impact  this is the most important category to me  ill go without any feature to support a more environmentally friendly company  love your work bro but not including environmental impact in reviews is terrible 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,and dont forget that none of the idevices have fast charging  at least none i know of 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the apps and ecosystem points you gave to apple seemed to be in praise of the walled garden nature of the company  that being said i   agree on apples point for ease of use   side note  with the new laws passed in the eu it would seem apples walled gardens are about to come crashing down 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,like everything in life  there is only one right answer   it depends  if you like to do crazy and cool stuff with your phone and want a big range of prices  go with android  if you want stability  convenience  and a great out of the box experience  go with the iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i used android from  to  and iphone from  to now and i definitely like iphone better  although that rog phone is temping
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,can we just appreciate how he made the colors on the background the imessage blue and android green 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the limitations of apple has been my biggest turn off from day 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this was a great video and your reasons were super well thought out  although  i cant believe that you didnt mention side loading apps during the apps category  i dont know whether it would be enough to flip the result  but it is definitely an important point to be made in the category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,idk what to say about apps category  yes they are delivered faster on ios but the quality its doubtful  had problems with the game asphalt  were it was stuck in a loading loop  facebook messenger didnt pushed notification and instagram still looks horrible on ipads with the black bars to the side    also many websites dont bother to update their pictures to scale with retina displays so some of them are pixelated as hell  on android it takes longer to arrive but when its out at least it works and looks good for that exact device you have   most of the time  until it crashes 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,flip  and  and cant go back  was watching this while gaming on my front screen
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,sniff  you have come far my boy  i still remember the day you claimed hwavei was inferior to apple the day they introduced reverse wireless charging 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,does apple have torrent apps 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as a developer i think working on android is much better than being an ios developer  simply because of xcode 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the main reason why i dont think ill ever swap over to an android is because my phone isnt my main machine android has a lot of novelty features and in depth customization  but i wont use any of that because i have reason to also swapping to a new iphone is so easy with file transferring  just put em on the same network and press a couple of buttons and you can have all of your photos and apps on your new phone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,here in the  third world we have a budget category as well 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont get why talking about ecosystem you sticked to samsung when it comes to android  why not integating google services  gmail  sheets  ect  to android which can be used on multiple different devices should be the case at this point  plus ability to create own ecosystems  like samsungs one 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,and just what are you supposed to be  a smart phone professor   like whats the purpose in making these phone videos  last time i checked all smart phones especially iphone and samsung their both the same 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,di como ganador a easy for use a android y me salio empate  que decisión dificil 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,honestly its apple people who keep this dumb thing going  ive had both for a decade  i prefer the best android over the best iphone but i would also rate them the exact same as marques
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bs 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i will always go with an iphone because of the regular software updates and minimalism 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,value for money android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is not getting better to win you over  they are abusing social status and peer pressure for that
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no  the answer is graphine os 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what the point if u declare no objective winner here  so it depends  so this is clickbait  waist of time  sad i have to say 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,actually were the losers because we keep giving these companies our money for extra megapixels that we dont even need lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphones work seamlesly with other devices in their ecosystem making the apple products overall the better pick  had multiple samsung phones and you can argue that the phones just by themselves could be close or even better in some aspects  but at the end of the day  apples technology as a whole is on a different level and will provide a better experience overall  if youd like to rather use a useless stylus  brag about the  super fast charging speeds  or just look at fake photos of the moon while risking your phone exploding  a samsung phone is the perfect option for you  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,that doug demuro reference
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple still the best  it’s a phone  should be easy to use  all i need is to call or text   watch videos 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,got my first iphone   mini  in  because nobodys making small phones anymore  i have been so impressed  the lack of navigation buttons takes some getting used to but it makes a ton of sense and gives you back space  the best thing is no bloatware  you can even uninstall apples apps  theres a unified way to change settings  everything just works etc  only downside to ios is transferring files from computer over usb is a pain  itunes sucks so bad  especially if you have your own music library outside of apples ecosystem 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have always used android and did not want to get into the apple ecosystem  android has gotten very bloated and to function properly the lower end phones do not function very well  i am little hard of hearing and the lower end samsung phones have low volume even on speaker  android does make changes to the os simply so users cant find how to make changes on their phone with each update  if i go online and look up how to make a setting change on my os version it never has the same options that i have  i just got my first iphone  se   in the past week and i am impressed especially with the volume control and the intuitiveness of the phone  android is no longer intuitive 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android has got focus mode aswell
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,sorry apps are so much better on android plus u can play xbox and on iphone u cant 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple should do  things    let you back up to different platforms  not just icloud  i hate that i cant switch phones because ios doesnt allow backing up whats app to google drive  seconde very important flaw  you can not seperate bluetooth audio when connected to your car  when i am in my tesla i cant hear notifications unless i put my tesla stereo in bluetooth  nobody does that 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you missed the major issue with android   privacy invasion  and to those who say apple is the same  they really arent  google is putrid and vile when it comes to the insane privacy invasion built into the android system 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, customization   riiiight… same nonsense you hear from pc people saying that mods make it a better place to game than on playstation 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i am an iphone lover  can’t help it  won’t even buy a different one  it’s so easy to use and never lets me down 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the world needs to know that any android to android using google messages
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the epitome of elegance in tech review
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,some of these arguments are extremely skewed  which is to be expected  considering you are comparing a phone to an os  ios is extremely constraining  to the point where you don’t have even whatsapp on an ipad  or if you installed apps from different accounts  you will almost never be able to use them again  regarding ease of use  the only difference is marketing and user education  being stuck in the same system for  years would do that to you  if you take someone who never used any of the two  they will learn how to use it just as easily on both  as android devices can be dumbed down to the level of the user anytime  my parents are almost  and they have always used android phones and never had a problem with it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,finally a good recommendation video  thanks for teaching people 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how about safety  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one key metric is missing  its called price  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone  been using since   comfort wise maybe  got a bday gift before  samsung galaxy s  so used both samsung n iphone  end up giving the samsung to my niece  not coz its bad  comfort  didnt feel it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the deciding factor for me is apple has complete control over software and hardware working as one  for me phone  laptop are productivity tools and the tech has to get out of the way  i was an early android user and loved it but hated the fact as soon a phone was end of sale  which wasnt long in those days  getting updates became a computer science project  im using a  year old iphone  xs max  today and it still runs the latest os updated automatically  google pixel now comes close in integration of hardware software but the chromebook doesnt cut it as the laptop side of the ecosystem  microsoft has the surface but gave up in the mobile os race years ago  id say it comes down to if you love tech explore android if you see tech as just a tool  go apple  both are valid choices 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me  ease of use on iphone tops a lot of android  and this is coming from someone who uses android from very first time  just recently turn to apple  i feel a lot can be done using iphone  rather than android  sure  u miss a lot of customization thats not on apple  but you can get like a lot of productivity  hardware better   camera better with iphone  and so far  my only problem is battery health for iphone  pro max 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,focus modes are available in pixel btw   not androids are created equal
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have been an android person for so long  but since i switched to iphone  it really feels premium
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont buy in the fact that apples ecosystem is better because apple limits you inside this ecosystem  thats a no go for me  in fact  the comparison is pointless because the consumer targets for apple and android are different  apple targets tech illetrates wanting something exclusive and working  wheras android targets  types of consumers  the ones left in the dust due to price  entry level  and the techo geeks wanting to exploit all possible features by tuning the phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you want to know what mkbhd actually uses  look at his wrist 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as for software n chipset iphone wins  but other android   phones wins
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i strongly considered iphone in   but ended up with a pixel  because the price played a huge part   id only been on android before and pixels seem to be the best presentation of that in terms of features and software   plus i liked the design   almost two years later  its still running great   the fingerprint scanner totally sucks and the battery life is a mess  but im happy with the ui     there are a couple of things pushing me toward apples direction though   a major one is that i got a mac studio and a macbook air within the last year and am amazed at how seamlessly they work together out of the box   i use them together just because i can   if the iphones and apple watches are anything like this  then ecosystem would be a major factor   my samsung watch  mostly  works with my pixel   it was solid with the galaxy s  but still   sometimes text notifications just dont come over   even the messages app on the phone sometimes misses a text   carrier issue or software hardware  i dont know   the other  which may be related  is that im just tired of bugs and troubleshooting apps and connectivity   im sure apples stuff will occasionally screw up too  but i hear much less from iphone users about bluetooth problems or the camera app crashing or the gopro app not working with your old camera because the os was updated   the infamous  it just works  factor is very compelling    the things that may keep me on android are the assistant and price   i use google apps for everything  so a google phone is easy   or even samsung plus nova launcher   would it be difficult or possible to get google assistant to work by default on carplay   with google assistant and android auto  i can just start on my phone and it automatically takes over in the car   theres also the price thing again   it would be quite easy to just upgrade to a pixel  pro  use my old pixel buds  and maybe just update the watch   there would be a better camera in a phone that will cost   less and let me do more     i definitely prefer mac vs  pc now after a lifetime of windows and im sure that diving into the whole ecosystem would be convenient  but im not sure if its worth the extra cost of the hardware   i simple stable os is great for desktop laptop  but i think the big value with mobile car is google assistant   that makes this a tougher decision 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,found out who one as soon as video started what’s on his wrist game over iphone wins
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,goddamn this was a great video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,huawei
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i just find it odd that if you watch marques in public or in interviews  he personally thinks iphones apple are not that great  but on this channel  he always pumps up the iphone as being the benchmark  makes me wonder if  officially  he gets paid by apple to say nice things here  it seems fake 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there is no winner  its a matter of personal choice 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,support and ease of use is bullshit
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,oh yes  iphone wins in updates  especially when it slows your old phone down so you buy a new one 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i literally feel offended by giving a check of apps to ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i remember when jailbreaking was fun to do back in the day  not so much anymore 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my  year old son just got diagnosed with t diabetes  can you do a video on diabetes tech  would be super cool  i bet you could find a lot of people to help you out  love everything you do 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i just miss the features they keep taking away  like ir blaster and a normal   screen  i have an lg v as i use the blaster almost daily
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’ve been an android guy since i was old enough to buy my own phone  started out with the incredible  but i got a new job a few years ago and everything i do is run on an app that’s only on iphone  reluctantly switched over  preordered the  yesterday but if they ever develop the app for android i’m going back immediately 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marques  i hereby pronounce your new nickname   switzerland 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the fact that we even compare one phone  one company  the iphone  to an operating system with literally  thousands of different phones just shows who is the clear winner
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this video should have waited until october th when the pidel  was announced 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it comes down to personal preference… both amazing smart phones  i’m still team iphone tho
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i honesty detest the cloud of snuffulologest that apple people carry  adroid is freedom and options to make your own choices 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone all the way android are very easy to hack specially samsung
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ever since steve jobs passed iphones went to shit they are good but steve jobs wouldve had way more advanced ideas foe each new model to keep the brand the winner of every competitor
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me  its android simply because i like my phone just the way i like it
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nobody cares about apple outside us 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marcus has openly admitted to preferring android over ios in a podcast 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,solid comparison   two critically important categories you missed  hardware   security  you could argue security has a higher variability of importance  but hardware is a massive consideration  sure  android has an insanely broad range of hardware  but it would be helpful to see the comparison across the range as a whole as well as  pinnacle  android hardware examples
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,let me guess  a marques video pitching android vs iphone would have iphone winning  lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,price is the winner for me  period  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps on ios are more polished and works best  also games they come earlier and faster on ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  they have this and t v and lights  sound bar 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,face_with_tears_of_joy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,phones are really personal  i recently tried iphone for a year  ease of use man  no  it is a burden  so now im back using android and samsung  there is more to this  a lot of corporations are blocking usb drives and if you are working on the go wifi tethering is the only thing that works from iphone  android however allows teetering via cable which is more secure than wifi  it is easier to listen to wifi shared than cabled shared internet 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,debate is for excitement and fun  most people dont care what others use  hopefully 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as someone who dailys a iphone  pro and a oneplus t   i fucking hate doing anything on the iphone  thinking to switch to a google  or something similar and retire the iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,from  i went back to android and also bought an android tablet  then i saw the quality of apps on an ipad and iphone and i couldnt believe the difference  the android apps sucked back then  went back to ios in  and now have the apple eco system  it just works for me  i have been wondering how far android has come after  though  but i am happy where i am now  i have pcs for gaming though 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you want inconsistency go with android   they don’t compare with iphone period 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this really comes down to different people with different perspective  i am slowly moving towards apple at this moment  i started with a macbook and now ive got an ipad too  the iphone  is next on the list  since this works well within the ecosystem    i would consider myself handy in changing things on my samsung phone  but sometimes you just dont want to think about it and still have a sleek design on your phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you didnt include the  for hype  category to accommodate those people who buy iphones just because theyre iphones and perceived as better  at least in my country of south africa
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i almost buyed a pixel phone but the round sides of the iphone and smaller form got me into apple again 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,something that he did nto bring up for android that is big is the ability to pirate apps
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the winner was the friends we made along the way 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,every iphone back to  will get the latest ios update  makes sense since theres literally no change in the phone since   and the product has limited to no features customization available to upgrade  changing colors does not count 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,haha yes there both good   but being a samsung person for  years  newest versions vs iphone   id say samsung won this thats me thou  your video was great   my cuz is a big fan for iphones so this will help her decide also
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its  and he does not even try to hide his apple bias anymore  bruh android has focus modes since ages  we get dynamic island through third party apps  something apple doesnt even allow  with apple you buy a product but do you really own it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for some reason iphone cant store more than one item in its clipboard shocks me everytime  plus after mins it just resets the clipboeard
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i will only switch to samsung because they are way more innovative in their design and features  iphone is a stupid status symbol that i think should disappear  its making people weird about apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone wins apps  noooo sir 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marques in here breaking it down   you do this better than any other techie on youtube 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i didnt even know samsung stopped updating certain phones after a few years  i thought updating all phones every year was like a industry standard
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  i have focus mode in samsung android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the argument of  are we going to get a feature that android already has  doesnt really make sense because the feature being added to the ios ecosystem is more important than it being added to the android ecosystem for an iphone user   they are totally different platforms and while being patient is frustrating  apple waits until it makes sense and is polished  but that same exact feature in ios is different than it being on android if youre not an android user   the argument would be how that feature works within the platform it was added to  regardless of who did it first   android is better than it used to be  but its still too fragmented and there is no consistency in the design language  iphones are beautiful and the hardware goes hand in hand with the os  so with how fragmented android is its hard to compare because theres a different phone that does something very well  rather than a single device that does it all   the iphone not being fragmented will be the ultimate phone with all the features in one device by the end of its life cycle   if android phones want to add the latest camera but it hurts design they dont care theyll slap a huge ugly black bar on the back of a google phone for instance and change the whole look   but i would love to own both devices  as android i feel is more of an enthusiast device if you enjoy messing around and tinkering with bleeding edge and being essentially a beta tester   i was an android fan up until the iphone  came out and then ive been using iphone ever since and i love it  but i still think android does some cool things  but not enough in one single device to make it worth switching 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in my opinion  the aspect of updates and support  which inherently includes security  stands out as the most crucial and valuable consideration when choosing a mobile phone  regardless of the brand  nevertheless  we understand the importance of maintaining objectivity to ensure a fair and impartial outcome  thereby minimizing potential disappointments among the involved companies  anyway i prefer the iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love the huawei ecosystem 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the only big deal that gets me hung up about going with an iphone versus pixel is that girls like to see the blue messages 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the all important category for most  price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android since it aint connected to one single company only and it aint proprietary  if apple dies ios dies  if a company using android dies  meh 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i will go a head and disagree with you on  ease of use  with all the proprietorial programs like itunes you have to use with iphone its way easier to do stuff on android  for instance clicking and dragging fills from youre phone to the pc 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the new iphone  pro max is outtt
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,everyone who  has done  their research  knows the environment is not at risk  billionaire hypocrite elites using this ploy to make more money
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the android way the better  stick to your apple thats all 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android has a lot of potential but i find it lacking in basic functions  having to use a samsung s for work for typing lots of reports it sucks for text editing  my android elitist coworkers have no answers for my text editing difficulties  all i desire is an os and phone that allows me to get my work done fast and efficiently 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,another consideration should be price  android phones are available at multiple price points making it accessible to everyone on the other hand apple charges a hefty premium for their phone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,didnt mention the things that i care about   replaceable battery  linux wins  a few android models  unlocked bootloader so can install lineageos  calyx os  linux  etc   all linux models  some android models  sony  google  etc  privacy  linux and aosp derivatives are best  doesnt engage in surveillance capitalism  linux wins  apple is better than google   free open source  linux wins  google better than apple  free open hardware  linux wins with librem   pinephone and fairphone publish proprietary schematics 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i knew it  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hope i don’t regret switching from iphone to samsung…
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,both   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,did u miss the cost part 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,can we acknowledge for a second what a asset marques is  at this point  he has absolutely been approached countless times and offered who knows how much money to sell out  and the man remains objective  he is certainly financially secure  but he still works this like a job  staying informed and testing new things  im not going to name anyone  but we all know a few people we used to trust and cant anymore  lets all thank marques for continuing to be a source of reliable information today 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,based off your metrics i should be all iphone all day  because my most vital things are applications  updates and ease of use  but the apps i use either dont exist or are cucked on apple  the mdm features for mobile iron on apple are garbage compared to android  so i cant lock down an iphone the same way i can and apple and update them the same way  and ease of use  i cant even tell you how to change the brightness levels on an iphone  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i find that apps that are related to professional work are better on android  a good example is atak versus itak  i can call for artillery strikes on android  whereas on itak i can barely get all the maps to load 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,privacy should have been covered  a huge  and marketed  differentiator
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,s ultra z fold   dex offer by far the best most usability  and productivity options  innovation  gaming  and multi media experience  and thats why people buy a smartphone  how many smartphone users take pictures and video on a daily basis  who cares if a photo or video is   or   all images and video are perfect for   of all smartphone users   the ultra destroys the iphone on every aspect that really matters  dex  s pen  multi window  multi tasking  inscreen fingerprint scanner  knox  file manager  integration with x box live  windows and spotify   x optical zoom  super raw mode   mp lens  k video at  fps  camera integration with tiktok  facebook and instagram  far better widgets and customization options  themes  fast charging   w m reverse wireless charging and last but not least   integration of samsungs eco system smartthings with mercedess mbux voice assistant 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone will always be crap till they let people to use multiple apps at same time  android s the best onthat  you can not even watch youtube and text at time
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,customisation is king to me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my  years old iphone xs max works better than the pixel  pro i bought last year  it is a phone ffs  i only need to setup its appearance once and i never look at it again  who tf has time for this  i am not  anymore  can’t do that when i get  system ui crashed  or other app closed etc etc  and it is a google operating system on a google phone  and it’s not only me   back to iphone this year and never looking back  stability > customisation  plus  you are literally comparing s of android phones against  company and the  company still comes on top  use whatever you want to use but i am team apple all day everyday 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you sold your soul to appl mark how can customer service from apple be good with all the polemic on apple repair products
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i need android to change the text bubbles colors like  android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  if you are western people  yes  iphone is good option for easy usage  but some asian country  especially korea  galaxy is much bettet option for this 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,tbf updates is pretty irrelevant for the normal phone user  most people get a new phone within  years 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,system cusmization is most important for me  so android is the best for me  samsung is my choice  so im not worried about updates to  and most important its not chinese company 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im a little confused by the ecosystem part like do you mean the ecosystem it has or made  because androids goes so much further than just android additional products
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you can check as many checkboxes for android as you like  but come on  the choice is extremely simple    have money  buy iphone    no money  get an android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when i used iphone  i always want a google pixel but when i really got the android  i always felt pity just because it is not ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i never had a iphone before  everyone around my circle do doe  but i love the build of it  i think its a dope phone to look at  perfect shape and screen 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot price  i have an honor phone that costs a quarter of the price of an iphone and does   of what it can do 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,both phones are solid  but i made my switch from samsung to apple earlier this year and have not looked back  apple has all the accessibility i needed so i dont have to bounce back and forth between two different oss  the apple eco system is bar none  way what you want  id say both phones hold their own in their own ways and both have great value  but i found real value in the apple eco system and how fluid and easy it is to use   thats where you get your moneys worth  also  even when i was strictly an android samsung user  i always felt even though apple came out with features later  they usually did it better  i was always comparing my phones to my friends who used apple and  saw how much better the same features were 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i do appreciate how you try and tackle the most  based on user experiences and not just your own  tho i do feel like you thew a few soft balls for the iphone  those pros definitely are worth mentioning 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple does have seamlessness and environment down pat but the walls they put up for their own users to not dive into more os capabilities like file explorers and such will never make sense to me  ios is also a lot less intuitive to me   android has a dedicated back button but i have to search for it on each screen on ios for example  the options are nested makes more sense on android for me too 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,good analysis  you should have added price as a category too   it would be a perfect tie     many people i know buy iphone simply because of brand status  they dont care about any features  neither are they interested or capable to use those features 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im a bitechual i love ios and android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,honestly the only reasons i am on iphone is how smooth airpods work and imessage  family 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,can anyone tell me what the main android phone hes using is 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a karay  no sabía que se podía poner un video en  idiomas
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, im gonna give features to android just because of the small tweaks in the os    just those small features to customize your os  so its in the customization category not the features wtf
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone can beat android only in the usa
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps should be android since you can just download any apps from the internet unlike apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps   updates  ease of use 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i will die on the hill that dynamic island isnt a feature  its a branded lean in to the hole punch   which iirc apple previously made a dig in a key note 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is a very biased review or comparison i wouldnt be surprised if you were on apples payroll 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,sad but it’s really up to the user   apple to me is more intuitive but my son thinks exactly the opposite  six of one   half dozen of the other
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,good evening… just a thought  taking into account that patents in general are limited to  years of use and that there is great importance in combating commercial monopoly  because in our country we cannot start a discussion about patents for computer operating systems and portable devices  apple has had ios for  years and mac os for over  years  apart from windows  which was designed in …  brazil  for example  has had very positive experiences regarding the management of patents in the pharmaceutical industry in relation to generics and the fight against the aids epidemic   wouldnt it be interesting for us  as a community  to at least propose debating this  as our legislators may in the future regulate these patents in an understandable way in our country  after all  computers and portable devices are in common  daily use by our population in almost all commercial  cultural and social areas 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,tech people tend to vastly overestimate flexibility customizability  simplicity  reliability  and a nice package are so much more important 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why do tech reviewers always fail to mention the ease of use of androids with pcs  which i would include in the ecosystem category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot the most important category  price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i don’t know if i can get use to google having so much data from me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is innovative but messy  apple is streamlined
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i kinda feel like the  ease of use  category was made just to give ios an easy win 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i notice you didnt mention durability or how long a phone lasts  are they generally the same  does it depend heavily on which android phone  apple makes a lot of money off repairs and to me is one of the greediest  most self centred companies in existence and they may be the most valuable  i dont think i can trust them to look out of my interests when it comes to how long their devices last or if they can take a bit of a beating   im hoping youve thought this through but maybe you havent  ill have to look elsewhere for answers  including from an ethical point of view  apple doesnt put touchscreens on their macbooks because it would undercut sales of ipads  what other things have apple done to make more money by not giving me what i actually want or what is actually best for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the iphone is objectively better at this point 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  i can tell which device goes with each word 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,app point goes to android because you can manually install apps from outside the play store 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,cant believe this video with mln views acually made him earn k  crazy man
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me the most important thing is freedom of use 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i now have the  min and can drag and drop the apps any location
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone updates it more often to make planned obsolesce  and you give them a point for that  right 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i want my lightning connector  said no one ever
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the real winner is the one who did not capitulate to the eu lol  the jokes writes itself 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,that conclusion was brilliant  very well done  sir 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont care about customisation
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro tryna convince us really hard to move on to android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if my y old grandma can use her mid range android phone  a  without problem  i guess the ease of use is kinda good 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you have forgotten apks in catagory apps  for me this is a gamechanger
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you are too smart saying iphone is the winner but then again say you prefer android man
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee no
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,went to iphone after  years with android  all i can say is i wish i did it sooner  i only care for ecosystem   ease of use 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android does not have imessage
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i gave up on android for the glitchy animations stutters  longevity and having something that just works and doesnt have so many ads  i miss android but   yeah  not too mention clipboard to my mac and airdrop
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android has half the features apple has
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,pc  professional camera  done 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i remember when i was younger i used to love android phones and hate on iphones without even trying one before   i had a nexus   the red orange one  and after destroying it  i decided to give iphone a try  specifically the s plus  i never looked back 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,is the fold phone pixel or something 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think that  both phones are good and powerful  what is important in the selection criterion of a buyer or user is his taste and mood  which phone he chooses  what is important is whether he communicates with the phone or not   or what does he expect from his ideal phone   definitely  both phones have their strengths and weaknesses  and each one is designed and built for users with different interests  moods  and expectations   for example  working with iphone and ios phones will be annoying and boring for a professional user  on the other hand  working with samsung and android phones will be difficult for a user who only does his daily tasks with the phone   of course  an important point that was not mentioned in the video is having a variety of samsung products with every economic budget  in many countries  especially in asia  the middle east and south america  the price of the iphone is outrageously high  which is not economical in terms of  i think this is an important advantage that makes the samsung phone superior to the iphone in choice 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is a device for low iq folks whereas to use android u initially got to work your brains bcoz its simply more feature rich  iphone  was the last i used but also had a sony xperia  the sony was simply way ahead though it was a couple of gen older  however the camera was simply phenomenal on the iphone  that being said the latest xperia has one of the best cameras around   for my use its gonna be android  always
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this was the best and most objective comparison ever made  with a great rating system to fit in every individual separately   great analysis  great work as always   well done marques  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i only care about security updates and or os updates  but danrn it  iphone is expensive 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you wanna compare but you wont include the prices of the phones or the ecosystems 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love my iphone but occasionally i find things about it that i absolutely hate  like right now  i just desperately want my android tablet to automatically connect to my iphone hotpot  cant do it  apple says no  they will say yes if you buy an ipad  i dont need a  dollar ipad to read books   it generally goes   pick up tablet  thats right  no network available pick up and unlock iphone open settings open hotspot return to the tablet open network settings connect to iphone wait while it connects finally it connects yeet iphone across the room finally begin reading    why  theres a password for a reason  just let things connect  same deal with the android headunit in my car  just let it connect automatically ffs   so anyway  i think im going to buy an android now because my priority is time and apple keeps fking with my time  sorry to the wife for the green text messages  i believe in our marriage and we can overcome this hardship 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its interesting that outside the us whatsapp is basically the imessage and facetime replacement that everyone uses and for that it doesnt really matter which phone you use
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as an older guy now  i was an original android user back to the original motorola droid  but with every passing android i had more and more software and app issues with things crashing etc   i also didnt like the cheap feeling build quality    what changed me to an apple user was my old company swapped to apple products for their company devices and i was forced to use an apple    never used one before so i took it home over the weekend to get a feel for it and i kept finding myself saying  well that was easy       why doesnt android do it like that    i also noticed that when i did anything  it didnt crash   everything just worked the way it was intended        im one of those guys who falls into the ease of use category for sure     admitted the iphone cant do alot of the extra stuff an android can do  but apple does all the stuff i need it to do and it doesnt break down in the process   the best way i can describe my experience has been  i upgrade my androids when they break   i upgrade my apples when i want to 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it looks kinda strange that you didnt talk about google ecosystem  they have a lot of thing that connect together  doorbell   security cam  house heating control  etc 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wait wait wait  not sure why i clicked this video knowing the result for views  i agree  imessage  facetime  and find my phone  macbooks and ipads are an  ecosystem  but there is no way it tops googles real ecosystem with google assistant speakers  smart home screens  casting to any device ability  chromecast dongles  secuirty cameras  messages on web  share chrome mobile page to any laptop desktop with your chrome browser open  and the list goes on 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nibba put excitement as a pro 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,that is the beauty and beast of apple  the ecosystem  i would switch back to android in hot second if they had some cohesion in the ecosystem  just the ability of my headphones airpods to be able to automatically recognized by my watch  phone  laptop  ipad  and tv without any weirdness is worth it  the slow  years behind android  development is almost enterprise like  it keeps the platform more stable  but has really become quite boring and stale  usb c  woo hoo  yawn  right now you can get a oneplus  with really decent specs for  bucks  but again  that apple ecosystem keeps me here  and yes  i am upgrading to the  pro max from a  pro  and yes  i am excited about it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why no category for price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, vs  nice
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so in other words  android wins
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,irda  checkmate 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,who came here after instagram showing he made   off this video ummm me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,two things im missing is repearability  which is huge nowadays and longevity  you could say things for both  but imo repearability is definitely android point and longevity more so for ios  most of the time you can keep your iphone for  years and an android for    i dont fully agree with the ecosystem as vendor lockin is a real thing with apple  for example with garmin  an android can send and read messages  while an ios can only get the notification that there is a message  if you want a watch to work well with your iphone  you need an apple watch   as a cross platform developer  i would also like to add my two cents about developer experience and why there are more apps for android  two reasons  when building for ios you need a macos device  period  also the developer account for android is   once and for ios its  year  so for a young inexperienced developer  you cant start with ios  or at least it will cost you a lot more  there is indeed less hassle to get a layout working  but that is nowadays really no work at all  at least not in flutter  what is more work is getting your ios builds working  they very often break without any reason    and lastly the stores  you dont know how annoying it is to get your app approved  google play and appstore both are truly a horrible experience  but the reviewers on apples side are very often such a pain i made an app for my wedding and it was not allowed on the appstore as it was for to few people 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android has much features compared with ios iphones  to explain in bible history  just iphone is like adam  or maximum adam  hawa  just   but promotion is extremely super  i dont see any special  but has gigantic respect for steve jobs art   thankful 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there should be another category   how much you get for your money 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think next time you could add a very important category  security
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have a xaomi black shark   its a gaming phone with pop out magnetic triggers with a built in macro system tied to it  you can use them for more than than gaming  they also work as more buttons you can use for shortcuts  pulling out the camera  opening a specific app and more   ive have had so many conversations started because of it  ive caused like  sales for xaomi by simply using it near people  just having the option for a phone like this is the reason why i daily drive an android  its just great 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you truly are the apple of tech content creating
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,coming from gs to iphone pro  the iphone is a pretty toy  you need to use the cloud to transfer files from the computer its plugged into     say it with me    you will own nothing and be happy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,resale value 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bold of you to assume if im enjoying this video im not already subscribed  v
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i thought clickbait was dead in  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i want big battery  fast charge  decent storage  daily camera and a good processor  so i got myself a rog  still felt like a dream 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you just love the iphone  and thats fine  what you wont do is make samsung users think otherwise 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the answer is to always use both and a macbook  which support windows too   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,all i care is that the features and chip performance i want matches the price   reasonable price for   minimum of    antutu score gb rom amoled display k battery
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple users have one more option   peer pressure  oh you do not own an iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you dont know what to choose   then just buy two  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,of course he doesnt pick android  because hes too much of a sheep to admit android is superior in almost every way 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,yes
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about affordability  i think thats a pretty big check point  not talking flagships 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my choice is android that have more freedom than the iphone holding its customers as hostages with pay pay pay 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i disagree that samsung ui is harder to use for first time android users but apple is just significantly harder to adapt to 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is always the real winner  ex iphone user 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when it comes to apps and ‘quality over quantity’ the same could be argued for features  android has tons of features but even with the example in the video about switching refresh rates    how many people know that exist    is it available on every android phone    do we consider iphone handles variable refresh rates instead of the user   more specifically with quality over quantity  both have faceid but does anyone on android use or care about it  obviously yes iphone removed touch id
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,let me tell u why i dont agree with u with the ease to use choice goes to iphone   first this is my word domain   ive tested this for a very long time juts to know whats was on people mind  about that   ive selected most of the time very mature people ond mist of the time does who dont know how to use a phone at first like my old grandma  ive realized that people found that apple was to complicated to use at first in needed time  to learned ex opening an app close it or goes back to the last page l  switch apps  was a lot more easier to do on an android  as they only have to press one button to back  one for home  and one for menus   as for apple swiping is not really something that people will get use at first  and that was one of the main reason oldies never like blackberry phones as they were too focus on swipe 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is better than iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when talking about customizations and features the comparison is so pointless as this at first one of the main reasons why android even exist 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nice job on the video marques
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,not agree with app category
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as the defacto tech support for our family and our businesses  apple will remain the standard until android fully  containerizes  the backup  restore  and xfer function  broken devices  replacements  and upgrades are painless when the entire environment can be replicated on a new device with a single initiation procedure  start the process  walk away  and return to a fully functioning device  android and mfr processes vary and are too easy to screw up 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone camera needs voice activated shutter  like samsung has had for years   so useful 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the elephant in the room is cost  my android phone samsung galaxy a cost about   no iphone could compete with that  also you didnt mention the quality of the speakers which is the most important factor for me and the fact that many android phones have a  painfully narrow screen  i hate it  it makes writing difficult and watching videos less enjoyable 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone vs pixel
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have both  a samsung and an iphone  they re both good in different ways  the app selection in android is better but for banking with out a doubt iphone    a friend of mine buys an iphone one year than the latest  samsung the following year  he likes both worlds  the kids like the hand me downs too   take your pick 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,that instrumental tho  whats the name
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,also one hidden factor that really does it for some people is family  my family all uses iphone so it just makes sense for me to be on iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marques we really cant install many apps in ios thats my major problem that point goes to android for example suppose if i really want to download applications from google i can easily like mod files but in ios its really tuff we cant even do that 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung has focus mode feature
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would add cost effectiveness which android would definitely win  i remember buying a   pixel a phone that could take better pictures than any iphone at the time  it was awesome 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what abt privacy
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android for life  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,para mi los  sistemas son muy buenos y si tengo un s ultra
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you could install ios on an asus zenfone that would be my ideal phone i think  but somehow make it even slightly smaller
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,left one out  sound   bluetooth codecs and resolution
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you didn’t mention itunes
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think that accesibility is the most important thing in a phone for most people  because a phone is a device of convenience  if it aint easy to use it almost defeats the point  i dont see a phone as a smaller laptop  i see it as something to do basic things as effecient as possible
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the winner is clearly android  specifically samsung 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as always  jumping to the side of iphone   how much you earn for that  i consider my samsung not good but using iphone makes me sick  i can throw a lot of garbage on apple but just gonna mention one thing he think is  good  support   iphone users are happy  me as android user  never needed to call anyone or visit any shop for support claims repair 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would argue in the apps section each gets half a point since on android while you might get lower quality apps you get a lot more customization where you can install all sorts of emulators and maybe some tools for automation and all kinds of setups   this would make both oss get the same amount of points and feed into the cliche that each is good in its own way  but this is kind of true anyway   to keep it short if you have extra money and want a phone thats  easier  to use in a way  that you dont need to do customization choose an iphone  if you want to customize the phone and do all sorts of stuff without your freedom being restricted get an android   p s  the phone market is very mature so picking any phone is pretty good anyway   if above a certain price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,pp encryption > sms
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung ecosystem  wouldnt a better comparison to apple ios iphone be google android pixel  android is googles os  not samsungs 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i will say  i like the order of importance thing  everyone should implement something similar with any purchase they find themselves indecisive about  that said  as it pertains to this video  i’ve never met someone on the fence about iphone or android  lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple will never win this war because theyre alone while android is an army of unlimited options and tastes 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i want a phone with an integrated stylus  so sad i dont have a lot more options   thank you for the video  mkbhd 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lol  such an apple fan boy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,that may be true in the  west  but trust me in africa and other poorer countries  where internet connection  electricity  money is less available  android wins by  to  in a scale of   iphone is only for bragging  nothing else  you cant put sd memory  you cant connect to your devices  you cant listen to a radio  go away 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the system you gave at the end was pretty sick  nice 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its funny because they have that ecosystem benefit by default  not by design as everyone thinks  i get that it doesnt really matter much to most  it just is what it is to everyday people  but it slightly annoys me that they think this setup was somehow brilliantly planned and engineered this way  mostly based on some loose quote about liking control from jobs  when it was really just the mere fact that there was no other true smartphone os in   there was dumbphones  and there was the new iphone option  it was all brand new and rd party companies had no idea it was going to be anything of the world changing magnitude it became now  before that they just a device once and that was that end of story  there were no such things as app and ota os updates  phones just came how they came and then you got a new one a year or  later  in order for android os to break in to the very early days of the market afterwards in  they had to partner up with all of these cell carriers  phone makers  and rd party companies for their distribution like samsung lg htc moto  cellphone carrier stores  amazon etc  where apple already had their grandfathered in independent sweetheart deals made to sell directly without the additional branding and distribution when no rd party companies had realized the   in partnering up and exclusive deals distribution arrangements yet 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think youre forgetting  important consideration  value  how much bang per buck youre gonna get 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,androids are far better than ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this reminds me of car history shows that on s s cars and how massively competitive they were  felt like on the consumer side everybody won really 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in the  app  category  i dont think ios can win until you can sideload an app without jailbreak or rooting  and i dont think ios will ever do that 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ecosystem is either a draw or a android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this video is so practical  thanks man  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its incredibly unfair that its one operating system versus so many variations of android  these videos are the simple reasons why apple users would go on to use this in an argument and stereotype every android into  category to say that apple is better 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  for hz screen  g+gb storage  in   apple must have been under us sanctions for the past  years 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android for the easy win
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think value and build quality are  important cateogires that should also be considered  with android having better value and apple having better build quality 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i can tell you this apple carplay whooping android auto every dam time  also  apple watch features and ease of use are way better than android  i agree android phones look cooler and there are tons of thing you can do with them  but iphone just works better  more practical  and sometime flawless
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so this video just drops conveniently with iphone  release  great strategy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,were is my pitchfork 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,at the end of the day i was a big android fanboy but got so burnt on the buggy software and shit being slow  switched to iphone and haven’t went back  sometimes it annoys me but i just get over it lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have been running an iphone since  with a two month hiatus to an android in between iphone  and   i will say that the phone themselves without the operating system goes to android hand down   zero competition from apple  the quality  look  feel  and handling of a samsung or pixel or lg is phenomenal compared to the iphone  the os in my opinion  as a normal every day user  goes to apple  if i could run ios on a samsung s model  it would be the perfect phone  i guess that will never happen but it’s what i would want in my pocket if it was available 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,all that imessage  facetime etc  its a thing in the us  the rest of the world doesnt have that  complex  and ease of use man  as you said if you can customize everything on android you make it easy to use as you want 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me  i love the iphone camera and how clean it looks but i am someone who cares a lot about customization plus  call me crazy but for the last few years i have had huawei phones and even though they definitely not the coolest in the market  my comfortability with them has made them the easiest to use for me so i might be the only one to say this but  i am loyal to huawei
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i constantly move from android to apple and vice versa  there is always something i miss from android when i use apple and miss apple when i use android  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why did you even make this video  bruh 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,did he say thread instead of x
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,to be fair  i dont think the iphone is easy to use  the settings options layout are not intuitive  siri cant tell me the weather to save her life let alone trying to open an app  and ive had an iphone for work for the last   years and it took me way too long to figure out how to attached a file to an email   googles ecosystem  especially paired with a smart home is very impressive 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how about both sides stop crying all the time  and just accept people prioritize different things in life 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphones really arnt anything special from someone who owns one yes they have very powerful chips but realistically   of iphone users will never utilise the full power of there chips  the best thing about iphone for me is who they feel personally theres no other phone that feels as nice in the hand as an iphone  but when it comes to features and getting your moneys worth along with quality speed and fantastic cameras and audio androids are still way to advanced  it seems everytime a new iphone comes out its always a new chip never packed with new helpful features like an android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,excitement should go to apple because apple users are more excited for the new features  even if already in android  than android users  apple users also know when apple releases a feature  it’s going to be perfect  can’t say the same about android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,biased  not everyone sees customization as a plus how can it be a factor
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how much did apple pay you for this  lmao
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,can i redo your logo 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love that apple gives updates support for as long as they do and this is coming from an android user but lets also be completely honest  what percentage of users especially apple users are using a + year old phone  and even if apple gives os updates that really doesnt matter since most apps lose compatibility after a few years forcing you to upgrade your phone anyways and this is true for both android and ios   i think the best practice is to take and use the best of both worlds and stay as vendor neutral as possible personally i use a android phone  ipad tablet  and windows pc and have all  working together without any issues 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have tried an iphone  and it doesnt work for me  my samsung z fold  fits my needs  i also do a little gaming  and apples computers cant match my system 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love this vid   thats all 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,man i feel like the console wars are back for phones lolololol  alright the next vid is xbox vs ps right lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone just loves being the last to hqve it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,things nobody talks about  ios    relies on servers to work at all  and thus can be bricked by apple if apple choses to or of the icloud servers are shut down   does not have a proper way to copy data to a computer  only has ptp for photos  and requires a special protocol that can only copy everything at once    is encrypted on multiple levels android    has very easy app sideloading  not locked to a first party app store    has much more connectivity freedom  mtp  ptp  cd gadget mode  usb mass storage mode  bluetooth file transfer    does not require signed operating system and is open source  can be bootloader unlocked  and root gives full access  while jailbeaking is much less supported by third party 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when google had its nexus line it got updates fast and for quite a while even say nexus   got all updates for years   sometimes they werent official   but was still able to run latest updates
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i had both and i like iphone because i don’t need all those extra features and extra stuff i’m supper simply the only thing i think iphone missing is having  apps at once and the ability to move the apps where ever you want
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro  marques  as a mexican i can tell you that the spanish dub of your videos is unbearable to watch  its like going from k to p  id advise to do it better or dont do it at all 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i absolutely hate seeing  iphone vs android  for a simple reason  iphone is a product name  android is an operating system  i would be totally find with it if people just said ios vs android  if you compare the hardware  you dont say  android  just because it runs android  you dont call nokia phones  symbian  or  nokia os  if you compare the google pixel with the apple iphone  you should call it pixel vs iphone  and why not compare two phones that run android  like galaxy vs ascend  its not right to use words that compare apple to everything else on the market as if there is more than just the big mother company apple  and the rest is just some wanna be apple  but its android  i see the words  iphone vs android  multiple times a day and it gets me super mad every time  i know nobody ever reads my comments and definitely nobody cares about this but personally it drives me crazy  please compare two things that are of the same type  while programming you cant say  bool == int  its not the same thing 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thats the problem with marquez hes kind of like warm milk theres nothing nothing super exciting about it you know what its going to be like cuz he always takes the same direction  never say anything that will offend anyone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think its not iphone vs android  its apple vs lots of android company  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hes right on the ecosystem thing  however  in my scenario its different  my family of  uses all samsung so instead of airdrop  we use quickshare and it truly does affect a person when buying a phone because if i change to iphone  itll be hard to share media with my family  i agree with the customization too  i use mac and ipad but for some reason i cant let go of my samsung phone because of the customization that im used too  hes right  we dont need to use only one brand  switch it up to fix your needs 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  wrong  samsung galaxy records k videos with good stabilization  waiting for k  fps in samsung  no iphone does that  it is a day and night difference when you look at k video playing at k monitor tv and k playing on k  it is a completely different quality and details in image when we talk about k videos from s for example  all iphone lovers like you will always never raise this topic  because iphone only has k recording 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,and after twenty years apple still doesnt have split screen where you can have two apps open to the same time on an iphone  you can do it on an ipad  very sad
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont recall iphones suddenly catching fire inside of peoples pockets  having been an android user for a decade  i made the switch three years ago  i used to root my android  install custom roms  do everything a super user  nerd  would do to make an android phone my own  those customizations always came at a cost  plus  if you arent using a google phone  you have to wait for three approval processes before a security update will be applied  google has to hand it off to motorola  samsung  lg  etc  and then must be handed off to each carrier to add their development thorns  and then updates come ota  with iphone  and now google pixels  you get them directly 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forget performance
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,main feature from ios that i would like to see on android is  all pics exchanged in a messages conversation grouped together with that contact  having to scroll through an entire conversation to find a pic can be annoying  subtle but useful imo
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,they should just make a iphosung  iphone   samsung   phone just the combination of the  combanies to with both groups kkkkkkk they should eish 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i cznt see me ever have an android phone but tbh that battery charge limit   thats definitely a good thing  i hate accidently charging my phone to  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,honestly  for me  there is no contest  the only iphone i ever had was a s  but other than that ive been android through and through  its just feels different and better  i do have an apple ipad  but just when it comes to having a mobile phone  android and mostly samsung wins it for me  times out of 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would have put in the list of features some much more important than apps  they both have everything  things like  privacy features   safety from malware  etc  the result would have been very different
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,money is always a factor  some people just want cheap 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,another major category that should be taken into account is choice of hardware and form  of which android would be a clear winner  to me customization and features matter the most of the categories in the video but choice of hardware and form like the folding phone or even something simpler like size  is the main thing  android all the way 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marques  you forgot a big category  price  there is no cheap iphone relative to android and a lot of people arent going to spend  us+  its   our dollars here  for a phone and as far as i know  thats where the iphone starts out  also  like another commenter said  serviceability reparability is very important and apple straight shits the bed there 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wth is imessage  been using iphone for  years  never used it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hey marques  could you kindly recommend an android phone  like the best android phone according to you 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the google ecosystem is clear of the apple ecosystem  i use my google account and google based software for everything
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive was iphone user from the iphone  to the  pro  and switched to the fold   years ago  initially i was psyched on the hardware  but eventually the reactivity slowed down to the touch like the   walmart androids  the main difference is i spent   for the disappointment this time  plus they had to replace it twice because the folding screen kept getting the black bar and losing touch controls  back to apple as soon as the  drops and i couldnt be more impatient rn 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,adding environment and impact category  apple win one point more  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as usual  usa= the world 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great and very reasoned analysis  i am an android devotee and have been since i put aside my sony ericsson phone for an htc hero   now im devoted to samsung  i appreciate the apple ecosystem and totally get the appeal of the accessibility they have with all their products  my wife uses an ipad over her laptop for teaching and note taking  both operating systems are more than we couldve hoped for just a few years ago and i think it is all dependant on what flavour you prefer nowadays 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would disagree on apps  genuinely it should be draw atleast  you can easily sideload almost every app  be it ios based instagram   whatnot  also the options we have not stucking in monopoly of particular app store blocks certain apps for political reasons or not getting more money from developers 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its incredible that cost  valueformoney wasnt one of the categories   cost  or at least value for money  is one of the biggest reasons as to why people buy one product over another   but maybe if you get all kinds of freebie samples to review  cost doesnt matter   you can get some very good mid range android phones these days for   usd these days   there really isnt such an option for the iphone  except for the se with its tiny screen     usd would buy you a used iphone in the iphone    iphone  range 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you get  excited  over  features  then you’ve created a dependency where the winner of one automatically wins the other  which should be avoided 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video  wise sentence in the end  i was using androids for many years  lg  motorola  businesses nokias with symbian also  but when started with iphone   now  mini i do not want to step back  easy to use and stability for years  had ip for  years  is most important for me  even if i liked to customize android in the past now i am tired of this  i just want to live and use smartphone as a helper 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the winner is huawei~~~
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the mere fact that an iphone can hold up for a whole decade  based on experience  and android phones slow down after just a few months of using it  based on experience  yeah  iphone all the way  worth my money and truly becomes an extension of my hand that i dont have to worry about  ever 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,yeah  iphone takes the win  for sure  no doubt 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,saying apple hates changing things for no good reason is a wild statement
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i was already convinced by iphone due to the incorporation of the usb c when it was announced  but this video made me   sure that ill be buying the iphone   i want a phone i could use for + years  and as a forever user of android  i can testify the os turns to shit   years into a phone  thanks mb 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,price is not a factor 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as a software engineer there are various points that make me turn up my nose     when we talk about features  all those features that are missing on ios due to the slowness to conform to standards  such as the impossibility of using webxr due to non compatibility with safari  are not mentioned  but the point still went in favor of android so no harm done     speaking of apps  one of the reasons why the appstore has fewer apps than the playstore is that to keep an app on the former you have to pay an annual fee while on the latter there is only a one time fee  an independent developer who has created a utility app and wants to make it public for free and or open source cannot do so because it would have an absurd cost to bear  apples policy doesnt lead to better apps  it just leads developers to place advertising or paywalls inside apps to make money from them     still talking about apps  its true that for android you need to develop for multiple formats  but its also true that android provides more tools to adapt to this  it is also true that  if we move on to the ipad    of the applications are an adapted iphone version  to date  there is still no whatsapp app for ipad     regarding the ecosystem  it should be mentioned that since apple has its own laptop and android does not  the compatibility and speed of interaction between apple devices is not comparable to that between android devices and windows apple linux devices
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hmm getting the iphone is expensive  gotta buy a macbook and that kind of stuff
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,can i add two more categories  service and repairable   android security   ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,price is also a factor that drives the choice  iphones dont have much discounts vs premium android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a lot of times  people debating this make the same  mistake  that you made for the first two categories  this is not to say that you made the wrong conclusion  but i think its important to compare things a little more fairly  android has more features  and more customization  fully agreed with you there  but it is also important to consider which has the more complete and better working features and customization  i am not saying ios wins there  i am just saying there is a difference  more is not always better  you even say it in this video when talking about apps   quality over quantity 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i do not care about all of this  i buy iphone być it looks good and expresie  also i do not change anything in my phone and keep it as it was when i buy it  i use google chrome and messenger  and sometimes i make ph call
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nice review  i worked as an app developer for quite some years and it was always because of the revenue  even with the same amount of people on both platforms  the revenue on ios is usually higher  since people owning iphones tend to spend more money on good quality apps  and one of the most annoying thing to develop around was always the apple notch  not only the android aspect ratio 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,emulation on android > emulation on ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i predicted which one will win which category  i have been watching these kinds of videos way too much 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think it’s kinda pointless to compare the two these days   honestly  both are so good  so refined  and so loaded with features that we’re just nit picking the details   the best one is the one that works for you  and i think that’s what marques is trying to convey   and that’s the honest to god truth  despite how corny it sounds   ios is really good   android is really good   they both excel at pretty much everything   both will get you where you need to go and do what you need them to do   and both also excel at their own things   figure out which of those things are most important to you  go with it  and be happy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,threads… lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the artificial limitations introduced by apple should be enough to rate them low in almost all these categories l 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,to me an ecosystem in one that isnt limited to a specific brand  android devices can conect with other devicese en if yhey arent even smart devices 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the ios filing system is an absolute mess  it duplicates photos and videos if you want to see them in the gallery 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,and thats exactly why i like iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple all the way if you want to keep your phone for + years  my pixel phone taught me a hard lesson to never buy an android phone if my life depended on it
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as an android guy when my mom switched to the i phone i had to look up how to help her for so much stuff i found easy on android i think the android app store is better it has apps i use and couldnt live with out and this is a big deal barker to me   also i phone cant side load  so to me android wins the app category hands down  everything else i agree with
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the most basic feature i miss the most from android on my iphone is being able to change the volume for media vs phone ringing vs text  etc  it being all one volume bar on the iphone is bonkers to me  youre listening to music that was mixed low at a comfortable volume and then a text comes in that deafens you  the runner up feature i miss is having letters  numbers and symbols on one keyboard face  iphone keyboard is still trash after over a year of having this thing  thought id forget how it used to be  i hope apple changes these things  but more likely im going to stop caring about imessage group texts facetime and go back to android  for these reasons and the rest in the video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,he added eco system go give apple points 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you should do an iphone vs samsung galaxy vs android video   samsung is a different category   so many better options and features than any other android  they are not just  android  there are  categories imo 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android all the way for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its mostly about what you are familiar with   knowing even some things to do is better than knowing nothing   unless you are a hopeless geek and have time to invest in learning new technology   most people dont   so iphone is still the dominant platform  because it was first   android is clearly superior and i have used both  most people who have used android gave up on iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,these categories were verryyy good established by you master  very well thought as always…  but  as you stated that i could add my personal categories  right  well  i would a new categories called  content creator  reviewer and tech savi  and the results foe me is apple and marques browniee    i a serious note  as always very objective and explained  awesome and god bless you 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well done marques — this is why you make a good reviewer — you can break it down to a system that applies it to someones personal needs  even if those needs differ from what is you  this allows you to enjoy techonology  without sucumbing to the usual fanboi tribalism of many channels  thanks for a good review   five stars   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,sorry  cant agree on the apps category and even the ecosystem  in my opinion  the ecosystem should be supporting but not limiting  glad that eu made apple get rid of lightning cable  i can connect a samsung or google watch seemlessly with my android or iphone but i cant do the same with apples watch or airpod 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’m still running an iphone x hehe
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive told myself alot of times ima go to iphone for my next phone  then i get around my friends   its  can i use your phone to charge my phone  everyone has white earbuds  when a watch makes a notification sound atleast  of them check their watch bc they sound the same etc  then in my mind im loke hell no this is like a sci fi movie about those mega tech corporations trying to make everyone the same 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android best
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,he says pick your  winner for yourself 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the best stuff goes to android  customization and features are far more important than updates and support  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if marques says the win for him is android then android wins hands down 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,all these ans changes from market to market  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video  but if you think about it  it’s iphone x n different android phones  not a very fair fight  but i loved you system to decide which phone best suit your needs
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,actually  apple costumer service in canada  especially in quebec  is terrible  i  for example  have to drive  and a half hours to the nearest apple store  i live in a city of   people why is that still a reality for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,can you talk about the huawei pro  the satillite phone  apparently under us   would that be batter value of iphone  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in my opinion my big thing  with my phone is video and picture quality and signal and being an android user for years vs iphone as my job phone  android is better in my opinion but thats my opinion 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,honestly speaking while the focus modes are pretty neat i’d say it’s a real niche feature that most of apple’s user base won’t even bother with outside of dnd
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i work in a phone store and i always tell people it really just depends on the person and what you’re gonna be using it for 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so apple fan gave big up apple phones got it
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this video is truth for a specific demographic  which is the demographic that watches your videos  you connect excitement with physical and software features… go ask the avg apple user  especially women  what feature they are most excited about…  look at previous waiting in line videos and think about asking the majority of these people what feature they can’t wait to try    excitement shouldn’t be on this list 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this was a great video  i like how you highlight how some things are more important to some people than others  all of the pros you talked about for apple under the ease of use section is why i like it better  easy to use os and no bloatware 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its always apple  just based on the resale value alone   apple products resale value is so much better than android products apple just has such a reliable product 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about privacy   i’m under the impression apple wins that one but i could be misinformed
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,whys the hand clipping at  lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you are very objective  however i have to point out that the ease of use goes to iphone is also because they have less customisable features features than android  it would be good that you can also cover security aspect which is important too  nice to have a video just dedicated to that    also in terms of support i have to give it to iphone  they are way much better in terms of customer service  i am using a samsung  their services basically sucks    thanks for the video  well done 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, great job  that’s actually one of the most fair comparisons i’ve ever seen 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  mkbhds hands look like they belong to a giant until you realize 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as an android user and someone who doesnt like apple ecosystem this is an excellent video  hits all the most imp points 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i used to think iphones were cool when i was in high school but i cant stand them now  i prioritize customization  look  feel  and efficiency which has ultimately led me to android  the iphones really only impress me with the ease of use so the only people id recommend them to are people like my grandma that just need a simple to use basic phone  personally  id much rather have a phone that can do what i want it to with minimal effort opposed to jailbraking an iphone to use basic customization options  apple is a garbage company too so im happy not supporting them  not to say android companies arent garbage but theyre significantly better when it comes to the right to repair 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what do you use to record these videos  i remember quite some time ago you said it was a phone that you use to record for vidoes  which was it  looks so good  i want to try it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,is the bitrate lower for videos on yt now  i remember mkbhds videos looking so much better
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use easily goes to android just for back button  and about ecosystem the world is not only usa
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for a person who lives in united states this category isnt important  but for me cost benefit is very important  i dunno in united states  but in my country even the most basic apple iphone is too expensive and android is more flexible about price  plus there are a lot of  people who just want their phone to send messages via whatsapp or using basic apps and they will not pay the price of a premium phone just for that  finally i will not start to talk about apple very expensive ecosystem 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,both are good devices  just go  for one you really love or just go for both
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i heard about facetime and imessage for the first time now   i have only used nokia phones my whole life  current one is nokia  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,performance  its all about performance  especially when lot of apps  data and years go by make a toll on the phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im an iphone fan and have been for as long as i can remember but my very first smartphone was the very first huawei ascend  to make this comparison fair  youd have to put a specific device brand up against apple and not an os like android which is in s of device brands  see what im saying  most people dont realize that ios is only in the iphone while android which doesnt manufacture phones  fornicates with every android friendly device on earth    so  if we put the iphone up against  lets say  samsung  the iphone would win every time 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i want to be  and still able to watch marques doing it with grace  honestly  and intelligence 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my favorite are people going crazy to get the latest color of the new phone  then slapping a case on it that covers it  haha  great video btw  the ending where you broke it down by each personality sold me on your channel  subscribed  founds you by mistake when you popped up after the apple event video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a really stupid way to compare  updates and support as important as features and apps  and a little better gets the same checkmark as much better  for instance  android customization would be a   and iphone would be a   and that same   in customization shouldnt get as many points as even   for apps  a weighted system would have been much better  for instance   points for customization   points for apps   points for updates support   also  samsung is far more flexible  dex for example  and updates more regularly than other androids  except google 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wow i typed like  paragraphs ranting till i got to the last line where i compare android to j cole and apple to drake    thing is drake is my favorite artist lol  i dont even care that j cole is a better mc  id rather hear drakes ablibs than a cole verse   and im not gonna argue with j cole stans as to why drake is just better to me  call him corny  basic  wack  idc hes still my fav   but popularity doesnt make something technically better 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i can mirror my samsung galaxy with my samsung tv just by tapping it   i can plug in my headphones and play my tv sound on my phone without disturbing others   my grocery list  todo list and many other important things are organized on separate pages on my phone  easily accessible and synced with my pc  i can update from anywhere   i automated a lot of my daily tasks with samsung routines   i have galaxy s+ that i bought back in  or   before that  i had note  that i bought back in   both devices still working fine with batteries performing like new  sadly  its my wifes  iphone     and now  mini  first two didnt last for more than  years 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,and that’s it  marquez’s name was added in apple’s announcement a few days later 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,can a android do airdrop  because no human should have to live without 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,buying a phone is not the biggest decision in my life and it shouldnt be like that  i think im not alone on this  you have compared the iphone on ios with a bunch of phones on android  i wish i could choose more  like wp for example  or symbian  but they are not existent anymore  the real deal for me now  when the phones became so equal  is the choice for the future  youve mentioned the ecosystem as the last criteria  when the prices are growing and the habits are taking root  you will not have the chance to choose in the future  it is sad that we have only  platforms for mobile devices  its all bad  there is no right choice except the ones youve done when your personal or and family ecosystem grew up too much  what i see is the fight between twix sticks  there is no real choice anymore 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hybrid  i use a pixel a phone for mostly photography and videos but my workspace is a  intel macbook air   its a little clunky transferring data from android to mac   and i still cant get into the app store because i forgot my password and apple insists that i use an apple phone  of a friend or at the apple store  to do that reset   i am in the hills and my neighbors are all on android or flip phones  kid you not   so i wanted to us apple to make a photo book  but i ended up just using shutterfly  like i was on a chromebook or something   i use google cloud  not apples cloud   shed life        be feeling the struggle over here   that said   it can be did 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android always wins for not locking down software  rooting outweighs any minor ecosystem perk iphone has for me  easily  i like to tinker with things and iphones just dont allow you to do that anymore  im a pixel man for life at this point as stock android is the most open mobile os 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,personally i find iphones super confusing to use navigate  and i used to use my ipod touch years ago  whenever i try helping an older relative with an iphone i cant figure out how to help lol 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,two other categories for me would be longevity and reliability  opposite of bugginess  just to clarify  by longevity  i mean how has the phone aged  has it been performing as expected or has the performance gone down over time  i switched to an iphone a year back and iphone just destroys android in these two categories for me  in my experience  android has a lot of bugs  even pixels  and whenever i had to rely on an android to get something done  it would mess up in the most innovative of ways  with an iphone  you know itll just work and that too beautifully  also  android performance has always worsened over time for me but iphone has consistency here 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,app win for apple  so apks dont exist
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone for me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,easy of use support win for iphone  ahhah what joke  not only is ios counterintuitive to use  also the costumer service is a joke  i bought a ipad to try the apple stuff  wanted do download some apps  it was required a fingerprint or code  i went with fingerprint  till then all ok  fastfoward   years i go to download an app and it asks me for apple id code  such code that i never had made  i ask for a new one say that i forgot  followed all steps to change it  used email  phone number etc  then in the last step asks me for the old password to make a new one  if say i dont know it  why are asking me for the old one  in the end  even using my verified phone number  email etc i had to wait  weeks to replace it  this is a f joke of a customer service  bought a samsung tablet right away and  problems since then  if i need to change some password is done within min  apple is just a joke  never in  million years has better usability than android  ill never buy a apple product for myself again
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,face_with_tears_of_joy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,intro music name please and thank you
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as a first time apple owner with the the rest of the family on the apple ecosystem  it’s been seamless  i was reticent to join the collective but one of my colleagues said  stuart it just works made me change after fighting for years  no updating several times a month  seamless between products etc  good work marcus  excellent video
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,mmmmmm i have a slight feeling that the rating categories are a bit tilted towards being winnable by apple  if even by a slight margin  example   where’s hardware options and features… 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,just more of the same regurgitated stuff from the last + years 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i actually love using the dynamic island everyday for multitasking with navigation apps  spotify  audible and timers
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont care which the winner is  i just want a reliable phone  after struggling with a samsung for  years now ive had enough  messages failing to send  email failing to send  the light sensor auto dimming brightness even though auto brightness is off  among other isuues  back to iphone  which isnt perfect but at least things are better optimized 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,imessage is really the only reason i have an iphone since a lot of people dont use whatsapp in the us
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,enjoyed the video very much  gave me a different way to look at the   could you also do one  if you havent already  on the iwatch and the galaxy watch 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,was that a slight dig at ltt   quality over quantity  my friends  if so  that’s hilarious 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, ill just stick with windows phones 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,only camera and security is matters and apple is at the top in both  end of debate
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,he always does this and it is beyond boring now like what is the point of making these videos when you are too scared to pick a side  not everyone can afford to buy both like him
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you need to stop making these videos marquees  this is like your rd one and theyre all the same 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  heavily disagree  prices are climbing to the point where to get features and performance parity with a oneplus cyou got to spend what that phone cost  years ago   some phones are actually worse than their previous versions   in every category bar iphone  the price has gone up a lot in the last  years  and thats adjusting for inflation and whatnot   iphone went down in price  tho  both relatively and absolutely 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  yeah but sideloading is a great thing  youtube revanced doesnt work on iphone  the actual goof telegram only works on android if you download the apk from their site  etc
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my favorite thing that android does that too my knowledge ios does not do is custom volume settings  say you are on a phone call and watching a video  on android you can lower the video volume while keeping the voice volume the same  vice versa too
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its been like  months since i bought my realme gt neo  w before i bust in the two weeks i was doing so much research about both iphones and android and finally decided to buy it and it was a very good decision for me because it has only feature that i want and it wasnt very good price also like  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the only thing i hate from iphone is how restricted they are with applications and banning third party apps  so i just use the iphone as my main phone with a pixel  as backup for things my iphone lacks  definitely not cost efficient  but i like to be able to do things on an android which sadly wont work for the iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so ecosystem is a   winning in this category is a point reduction 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nah the best is windows phone with nokia lumia
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about apple security philosophy  surely that could be measured in their features   ecosystem and add some value to the iphone  it is one of the many reasons why apple is great 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,pleading_face 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it was missing  topic  security 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,try making one of them before comparing
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this should have been apple vs samsung  because they are the king of android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,another thing that should have been mentioned when it comes to the apps category  some of the in app purchases are more expensive on ios compared to android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as an iphone user  i can admit android is x better when it comes to features and customization  however  imessage is just way too convenient for me to switch  if iphones didnt have imessage  i think they would be utterly useless tbh
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, is the threads app the same on each phone     shots fired at twitter   marques brownlee
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love costumization  apps  gaming  specs  price  so yeh android all the way 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,tired of youtubes endless ads  android destroys apple with this feature alone  sangsung galaxy fold  baby
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the problem is my outcome to this equation is i should own android  however  what really matters is the outcome of this for your family and friends that you communicate with every day    it doesn’t matter what i want  they are all apple till death  they will never switch unless imessage gets added to other phones  so i’m stuck with iphone purely because i don’t want to deal with being an outcast and missing out on family or friend group texts    out of my entire family on my side and my wife’s side  one person has an android  and we have large families all local to us 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,all this just to scroll through instagram and tik tok
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,tbh  apples os is not really any easier to use  i got an ipad pro  amazing tablet  but i still dont know how the hell to do some things on it  the lack of a universal  back  function is a huge part of this mind     ease of use  is heavily dependant on what the person is used to    got my grandma a cheap android tablet for whatsapp calls  set it up for her  locked down a bunch of things shell never need to touch  and its perfect  wouldnt be able to lock down the settings features on an ipad  thats for sure    there isnt a winner 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, are we finally goanna get usb c in a i phone    
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,huge differentiator right now that is keeping me from going back to android is the watch  the pixel watch is underwhelming and in dire need of a battery upgrade  cant leave my apple watch right now 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung is superior + ratio 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,does it have hz  fast charging and emulation  if not  then its not the best  many apps are locked behind iphone so theres no reason it should have won over android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is why i love using both cause they’re good in different ways but prefer the iphone though lol 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android ez win 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,people in third and second world countries will use android simply because they are more affordable  you can get an android phone with fb and all the social media apps with internet and a camera for  dollars and its pretty usable  and brand new  thats speaking for us here in the philippines  one of the most  on internet  countries in the world  sure  usa and uk may have iphone as their most bought phone but thats because people can afford it there  the rest of the world will still use android phones  android phone parts are also more accessible and the software system lends to better repairability  an important factor here since most users dont upgrade their phones every year and will be stuck with a phone for  or more years  theres also the ability of android to accept a different os which lends to its length of use  you can install a different os for most android phones due to its open source nature 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,where is the price   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,before i finish watching the video i know marquis will go with iphone  lets see the results
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i am kind of in between camps  i like the unique features on iphones like voice isolation  i know pixel  has the same  but you can only get that on pixel  pro  whereas it is on all modern iphones  on the other hand  data sharing  wireless hotspot  sucks on iphone   its a strange problem for such a basic feature  i dont understand why is it so difficult for apple to get right 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wow he actually picked android  im shocked 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,another click bait video   we know his answers will be depends what you like 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple has the best ecosystem  but android gets the best tech for the money and is less restricted
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it’s been over a month since my switch back to iphone   pro max  and i miss my note + sooo much  i’m finding apples  simplicity  to be a huge hindrance in terms of quality of life features  the best thing about iphone is airdrop and the streamlined texting interface that allows sending high quality video and the fact i can send stuff seamlessly to my other apple devices  but good god i miss my android  something about the customization of an android actually bolsters it’s ease of use in my opinion  of course it’s super overwhelming for any new android user to have to learn all its capabilities  but once you’ve figured it out  android really lets you customize your phone to the way that’s most efficient for you and my setup was perfect    also samsung quickshare never worked the way it should’ve  creating link files for apple users was pretty much useless because they could almost never get the files to load 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,videos like this is why i’m a shareholder in both apple and alphabet 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android  for me apple is too tight with its security xd  storage
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i pick the third option  a linux phone  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,another great vid 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,is it possible to add harmonyos to the mix 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,    independent volume control for iphone  yes  please 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple users  i want to know why imessage is so important  most plans is with free sms and you even got the rcs chat on the android   it got imessage  ok  cool  why is it important though 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,whats the name of the intro soundtrack
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android does have focus mode
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i genuinely appreciate that someone with such a community finaly gets to have a bit of true objectivity  were not there yet but aknoledging a different point calculation method based upon peoples preference is a good leap forward  and i thank you for that  another nice step forward would be to aknoledge that sometimes categories can have more subtle dissimilarities than they seem and different features dont make either of them necessarly bad but just different  you wouldnt advise people to use a spoon to cut through a steak however  you see where this is going  people will hate you for that but i guess it is in fact your job to go beyond that  despite the hype   all    for instance the ecosystem is not necessarily better on either side  as you said for smart devices for instance  the question is  can a casual user find a solution to overcome the lack of ecosystem native continuity  the other thing is   its hard to lock yourself completely out of the standard ecosystem  since you will meet people that dont use apple devices especially outside the us  yes the android + windows will ensure you less convenient ease of use but it wil ensure compatibility and reliability with every device on earth   of the time  ive measured with my bear eyes    edit   then again  i guess people would have freaked out if you didnt pick your side   good job afterall  you are going in the right direction  its good for your community
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,excellent comparison  thank you 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,m brownlee really creates these categories specifically to make the android   apple race as close as possible so he isnt one sided lol  have to keep the sponsors happy right 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i agree — apple here  also with security  i get leery with google seeming to harvest personal data without my consent
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple winning the apps section doesnt make sense  how is it that ease for developers and updates give point to apple while android offers more app choices  better prices and able to get ur apps literally from anywhere 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great ending 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,change my mind  text edition on iphone is horrible 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what ive noticed is android users hate iphones meanwhile iphone users are completely oblivious to the fact that anyone would want any phone other than an iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for some reason  thats the way it should be  at the end gave me goosebumps
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video and keep up the good work 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,and would also love in depth video of comparison of both the ecosystems
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,just one thing  focus modes have been implemented in android since android  and they are also good
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,still can’t connect  blue tooth devices to ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,having used both i think i prefer ios  especially since i probably have ocd and when i was on a droid would go down nutso rabbit holes trying to tailor everything perfectly to how i wanted it to be  including messing with settings i probably shouldn’t have lmao  plus  tmi  i’d get super paranoid if i ever sent nudes and then have to go through a billion cache and sub folders to make sere they were wiped from the device afterwards 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marques  you got so biased that it is not even interesting to watch your reviews at this point 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android have much more way to entertain you than iphone   anyway  thank for your sharing
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the iphone is the winner coming from a galaxy user
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the instagram or any e commerce apps sucks on ipad  it just the same iphone aspect ratio they show in ipad as well 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,may be i will try iphone next year for their new usb c 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well made video and informative  i will share some of my opinions on the subjects to note why i think android is better in categories where ios took the point     apps  quantity  i personally like it  there are many apps for android that you can use to further customize your experience with the phone  but you can also side load apps  is an app banned in your country  you can bypass that by downloading the apk online  be a pirate if you want  quantity is important      ease of use  support was mentioned  yes there are apple stores  but if your iphone gets damaged you can only go to the apple store  and we all know that they can be a bit scammy with it  android however can be fixed at any privately owned phone pc repair shop  and those are everywhere and in most cases it will not cost as much 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me they complete each other  i like to use mostly the ipad because it combines several apple devices in one  computer  phone  and gaming console  knowing well that its features  and  hardware quality will be relavant for a couple of years  with the ipad as good as the most recent one  i wont need an expensive phone  ill get like a really basic and good  battery  camera  features  atleast  then  a windows computer to complete my setup and thats it  the ultimate devices all togother  my choice is also based on the fact that the apple ecosystem is expensive  so for accessories i will get good bluetooth headphones or earpieces from another manufacturer  there are alot  a smart android tv with sonos sound system  i dont really like watches  or bracelets either  so thats my dream ideal environment knowing that everything has its own unique role
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the winner for me is android  but i like both
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,jailbreak it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,amazing vid 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why are no one talking about price  i dont want to spend  + when my average screen time is   hours per day  i manage perfectly fine with a phone for   while still having a new phone with new features and several more updates to come 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its like messi vs ronaldo  it will never end
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung vs apple  which would be the best if you compare in terms of just quality and reliability  like which phone will depreciate in performance and battery life less after say  or  years 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont think the ecosystem matter that much because most people dont have   apple products
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there is one more category    status symbol 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i really appreciated the last part of the video where you acknowledge theres no clear winner  coz  the best phone  is a very personal opinion of every individual  and i agree with all the points you made  because while im an android user  my parents are apple users  and the ease of use apple have really made using a phone easier for them  while im using androids for the customization and features it have over apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive used both iphone and android throughout the years  had an iphone for like + years  until it couldnt really do much  before that i bought the  samsung galaxy s  and that was also something i had for + years until i switched to the iphone  recently switched to an oneplus   tbh  it all comes down to  can it use the apps i use  yes  okay  and thats about it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  customization  you are correct    featrues  you are correct    ease of use  its mostly about what you are used to  when i use my girlfriends iphone  im just as lost as she is on my android  but i agree with you that not changing stuff is very important and android does it more    updates support october  for overall updates  october  for security updates  you are talking in your video about security updates  so thats  years of security update my friend  you are wrong    apps  android has more apps  also all the mainstream apps are there  fact that it might be more dificult for the developers  you are not a developer  you dont know what kind of tools devs have  is not your problem and shoudnt be a factor in this section  you are wrong    excitement  neither new iphones nor androids are interesting anymore  its a mature technology  but yeah  android is slightly more interesting  you are correct    ecosystem  not really an argument to me  but ok   the real score   for iphone   for android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i was android for  years up until april   then bought a macbook  then a iphone  then a watch and then an ipad  all over a period of  months  the integration between products was just miles ahead of the android products i had  plus far less bugs  i miss aries of android  but overall  for work purposes the apple ecosystem is still way ahead 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i phone has no sim card slot  it also has no sd card slot  apps are sold at a   mark up  oh  also it doesnt even have a proper app droor  the winner is obvious 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i like android  my iphone wife cant find jack on my phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is king 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,features android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as a life long android user this is all great but at the end of the day iphones build quality is just superior and there is no way you can use an android phone for as long as you can use an iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro is definitely being paid by apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,could someone please tell me the name of the background music that plays in the first and last few seconds of this video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i had a samsung s  that i loved and just finished paying for when my support time was over  when i did have security updates it took samsung up to mos to get even the most critical updates out   i already had an ipad so i gave the iphone a try   i love it  i get updates in days  not months  it interfaces with my ipad  it has imessage which i used to text friends free in norway and finland on vacation   the deal maker for me was critical updates in days with iphone  not months  and +yrs of support with new operating systems and security updates   i dont plan to go back to android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,do you really have a plant in the old macbook pro trashcan   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy  im looking forward to that   grinning_face_with_sweat 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one very if not the most important criteria to compare any kind of products  the price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my   reason why apple wins in my book  imessage  i can chat with half my friends   family with one app  then there is the other half who force me to use google chat  signal  whatsapp  facebook messenger  skype and sms because none of them agree on a single program and none of them do what imessage can do or integrate as well   mind you  i use to be an avid android fanboy owning more than a few over the years  but then i took the leap and tried an iphone and used imessage for  days and subsequently returned my galaxy and kept my iphone and havent looked back since 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,been following marques like forever  his reviews are always premium  top notch
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my man just ended an entire debate lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my biggest problem with this video is this  ecosystem  category  youre telling me that the cult like design of the apple ecosystem  not letting anything else connect to it and charging exorbitant prices for the products  is better than the almost open market of products that fall into the  android  ecosystem  simply by virtue of not being branded as apple  the difference in cost between the two is incomparable someone could buy a   android phone  a   smart watch  a   pair of bluetooth headphones  a   tablet and a   laptop and have the same amount of connectivity with the right apps as the   phone    laptop    watch    headphones and   tablet  arguing that the apple ecosystem is more  seamless  falls pretty flat when you consider just how much youre paying for that convenience  not to mention that every device in the android camp can be further customized to do literally anything that anyone could need  where apple locks you into their padded room and drip feeds their consumers with features android has had for a decade or more 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i don’t get how the camera upgrades get glossed over even having a x optical level quality on the regular iphone   also the screen brichtness will be very noticeable and useful for people who use navigations outside often  i think it’s a solid upgrade from the iphone  or   i don’t think upgrading any phone from the previous year makes sense anymore
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,on pixel  i have focus modes
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,team ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,all i know is that iphone sucks
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i don’t agree with the ecosystem  they are not equal  this point was between ios and samsung  so it was not between android and ios in my opinion  apple has an ecosystem between all their products and its been like this since ages  android has ecosystems depending on the manufacter  i’ve used iphone since the  plus and recently tried to switch with s ultra  bought for each all of their products and even if they are close in some ways  they are not 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thank you so much for the video  its so helpful
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android has clipboard 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my take during the ad  iphone cameras are like the matrix level good like its fake they disect human eyes or something but android is better on every other aspect 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it’s all about personal preference for the average user  it’s always been that way  it’s the extremists that have turned it into a stupid hate iphone war  just like everything else on the planet that gets turned into a love hate war… the louder you squawk about something the more people join in on one side or the other    also       anyone know what app this is 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hats off to marques for teasing all of the new iphone features without breaking the embargo  well done  my friend 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,having a full featured request desktop site mode on chrome on android makes safari look like a toy on iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one important criteria is missing  would be price   affordability  that would move the needle by a lot 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why didnt he talk about performance and gaming 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one of the best comparisons ever  excellent video marques 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i use a windows laptop  the problem with apples ecosystem is it completely breaks when im not using an apple product 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i bought the iphone  pro max when it come out and spent a lot of money on apple devices  last week i spent  k going back to the pixel and google devices  pixel is so much better than iphone  google products also 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,security  google will freely share your info where as in apple takes customer security significantly more serious
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wheres the nokia column 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i don’t agree with the assessment that the apple ecosystem is better  android integration with google services and smart devices is a hundred times better  add in google assistant for voice control and it’s no contest 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple lost the update support category and my business for life when they pushed out those battery processor updates that pretty much made you feel like you needed to upgrade 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would have liked him to include durability as one of the categories  i think this is another area where apple wins and one of the biggest reasons i continue to use an iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,u s  best phone is iphone meanwhile the rest of the world is android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i just cant understand how people use iphone without a proper file system    not having settings of each app inside the app instead of going out of the app   to settings just to change a setting 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,sorry  ease of use should have been a tie or not included  they are both equally easy to use  in android vs apple  if you include samsung  well even more so with its simply mode which takes it even further 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple has the worst fans and elitism though so i feel thats a negative point there
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,excitement  bruh
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it would be good if you added cost  since usually android phones are much cheaper than iphones 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,weird how you look around you have a prompter in  different angle 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,havent watched this video yet  but i vowed a couple years ago to never go back to samsung  and my pixel has been so disappointing in terms of battery life  i honestly think i might have to switch to iphone  i already have airpod pros  which make the blow a bit softer 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what else do you guys want to see respecting innovation   both android and ios devices  phones  tablets  wearables  etc  are miniaturized computing devices that the only thing they have done since they came out  is giving us incremental changes in the hardware  and a surprise here and there software wise  in the end and for years they all serve the same purpose  use consumer and communication applications nothing more  nothing less  unless our smartphones go holographic  or implement some sort of future tech that make us feel like we are living in   from my perspective innovation could come from ai and how to implement it at a biological level to enhance our current limitations as human beings  in this sense  i believe that wearables will have much more prominence in the coming years than smartphones 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,anyway each to there own’       android     you tell it what to do         you can have the apple on your android phone       yeah      so it’s very smart        
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,funny  once again  like in so many little things in life  i don’t fit into any category  i want something that not only fits but can be operated in one hand  the third party finger ring thingy does that  i want it to be durable  the third party case does that  i care about the money i’ve already invested in the device such as the music i’ve downloaded over the years  apple music keeps me hooked in that regard  i just feel meh about all the new  features  that come along  the island  new gestures  blah blah… i’d so dump this big block of tech in my pocket if i didn’t need it to answer actual calls and i thought the watch would do that  except everytime i walk out the house without my phone my watch devotes it’s day to tell me i’ve left my phone at home until the battery runs dead at pm  so over all of them too busy competing with each other they don’t want to listen to people who just want to do people things 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,just my opinion  ios focus on users that just want to use the phone  period  make calls  answer emails  msgs  etc  it is point forward  android focus on users that want to trick and install and hack and do shit like this  it all comes down to the preference of the person using 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,mb is a national treasure
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i watched this on the revanced app that i sideloaded onto my pixel 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me  i like to compare ios and android using the analogy of android being a car  ios being a motorcycle  both can take you from point a to point b  but android is more clunky yet more practical while a bike is more efficient yet less practical than what a car can do 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,privacy and security is the most important feature  for that reason alone android is a no go for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,continuou camera = droidcam
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the biggest differentiator for me is privacy   security   and for that apple has been the clear   consistent winner 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me   customization    features    apps    excitement    updates    ease of use    ecosystem     apple    android   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nokia lumia  still the true winner
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thats a great system  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it’s the iphone… is all i’ve heard 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,probably the best iphone vs android video i’ve ever seen  in the end  it all comes down to personal preference  so it’s best to use a rating system where you have to consider which aspects are most important to you  amazing video as always  marques 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it’s actually iphone vs samsung  android is not the same in all phones  i’m sure all y’all techs know that already 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,your name is in the   apple event
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, in the us  was extremely important to point out  the rest of the world just uses whatsapp and forgets about imessages and facetime 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apples and oranges  but both are amazing devices  iphones have the best looking pictures and im an android user for the past  years  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone  pro max sucks lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this was easily the best apple vs android comparison ive seen yet  i used to be apple but switched to samsung  years ago because i just didnt get excited about apple anymore  for me  android is where its at  and i still love my samsung  i still get excited about it and often times find myself picking it up and opening it for not actual reason other than i just want to use it for something 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,read the vanderbilt google data collection study  will never use android again 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nice comparison  i would like to add something  android phones  especially samsungs  like the s or s series  are more rectangular  more stretched than iphones  this makes their screen fit better with the cinema format of movies and therefore better suited for watching movies using the entire screen of the phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple custom services are only good if you buy the phone from apple   bought else where apple say no help sorry even for their latest phones plus in europe every phone gets  years support by apple its a year which has caused apple many court cases   usb c is now on the latest phones thanks to europe
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about security  virus  android phone runs any apps  every phone beside iphone use android makes it difficult to use because if u use android on samsung it will be different on lg or google  ios is the same for all the phones  iphone have more hype better hardware  iphone looks more prestigious iphone technology have a luxury feel to it  i know i’m bias but iphone has better value
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple quoted you on the last event come on man you know apple is just better quality 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i can guarantee less than one percent of users are side loading apps or repairing their own phones  totally understandable to leave these topics out of the conversation 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would add an accessories category which ios wins hands down  everyone with an android either goes naked or has some janky case
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no bloatware on an iphone is bs  any apple software would be bloatware that i wont be using  and i cant delete  try picking a different app for your sms texting than imessage  apps goes to android  sorry but  try sideloading an apk to an iphone  echosystem also goes to android because it frees you from that jail imprisoning shit apple calls echosystem  buy all my shit or get out  ease of use is a tie  androids dont force you to customize and without messing around with those things is the same easy experience  the only benefit you get from an iphone is to stop being bullied by people that own those devices in us and try to facetime or send you imessage when you have an android  i will give you this  smaller product variety does give an easy life to developers  sad for consumers though  at least macs do have an advantage over everyobody else thanks to the efficiency of the arm arquitecture  iphones are great for the people whos main use of their phone is basic things like social media scrolling 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,non existent file management on iphones was enough to make me change to android  and i was so happy about it   you didnt mention the fact that you can add a memory card to your android to have extended memory 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,your excitement category is based on your personal excitement marques
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about cameras  probably iphone ngl
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is far better in every category   apple is for idiots with lot of money to waste or have superiority complex lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,yh phone vs operating system 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone winner i knew it  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,windows phone  the customization king  rip you beautiful sexy phone you
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marques only wanted to seem fair not to make any of iphone or android feel bad
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,awesome
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bios check it out 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this video should have been made after today lol  well done tho  love the vids 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apples ecosystem  i dont care android what they have  with windows they cant never work
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  my android has had focus mode  work mode  and do not disturb mode since launch 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,life was much better without smartphones  none of you will ever know 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this always will be an endless debate due to the fact that its highly subjective  like at   i personally feel that android based phones top apple in every category except  maybe   updates  that depends on the maker of the phone  as theres so many compared to just  apple    ease of use for me is hands down the absolute most important factor of any phone  to me  android is so much easier  and quicker to use than apple  ive got an apple iphone that i have to use for work for over a year now  and i absolutely hate that thing  hate it   its clunky  not smooth  and i always have to take the few extra steps to open an operating app vs an android  this really sucks because i have to use my phone quickly for work   i think the ecosystem for android is more vast than apple  especially since theres so many companies pushing out products   i could care less about a smartphone watch  and really dont see the point in one 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,they should add an option in the settings to choose from basic user to advanced user  the advanced user should be given all those custom settings that android has and the basic users should have stock ios features for more easy use  they would sell a lot more phones if they did this 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is a sweatshop  cannot support this company 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple = prestige   android = innovation    prestige trumps innovation   yep apple strong only really in the 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro  i dont need to watch an hour long video to know whats good for me   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone phone  physical  android software all day  ok google is light years ahead of siri 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there’s one issue with the ecosystem argument for android  and that is its ecosystems are accessible from ios as well  the ecosystems aren’t android exclusives  so it really isn’t close at all   there’s also an issue with the features category  which is that you combine all the features from all android phones as   but unlike you normal people can only buy  phone  and when it comes to features in a single phone  iphones are usually head to head with android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lol how is iphone better in the app category  you said it was because app development is easier faster  so its better for software engineers  what about the overall user experience  smh
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thank you this is the most unbiased comparison ive seen
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well done  getting named dropped on wonderlust event followed u for a number of years and to be honest its well deserved ur one of the few reviewers that i trust especially when u open a video we not physcos lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,another major future in android that kind of goes unnoticed until you really try to navigate around an iphone is the back button 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android vs ios  not phone vs os
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is big step ahead android google samsung huawaii xaomi
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,with what u will catch apple now ha ha ha pro
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me the winner is the phone that lets me do whatever i want with it  customize 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,after watching this video  im switching to kai os  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,someones trying to shake his apple fanboy image 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i joke around about this a lot because i am a major fan of apple   but to be honest  as you point out  its what we use as individuals and is a very personal decision   whatever you like and enjoy and works for you is the winner 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the fact that one brand is compared to everyting else  says enough right 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great  but what about google vs samsung 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,sorry the ladies only respond to blue bubbles iphone sweeeppp
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,youre biased 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android over ios anyday
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,commenting after hearing tim cook quote mkbhd  way to go marques 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,every time you break something down into features and start assigning points  your bias comes flying in  and the end result is  pick whichever one works better for you  what is the point of your channel 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wow  a mention my tim cook himself  superb
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,customization is a hit or miss with android…  the typical screen of an android user is google search bar and whatsapp somewhere else on the grid with a red and black anime wallpaper… it’s a toy  not a tool 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,umm  ease of use  ive had iphone since  and i find music terrible  storage of music is a nightmare  sharing music etc  and then having to use whatsup still is embarrassing 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im looking for an arca swiss phone mount to mount on a backpack strap instead of sitting on a tripod  a plate that mounts on the back of the phone so i can snap it into somthing like a peak design f  i cant find any that have the arca swiss plate on the back only on the bottom  i thought maybe you or on of your viewers might have a suggestion  thanks  and as always  great video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,pixel get all the updates unlike samsung
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android  end of story    iphones are trash 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple stores arent everything   for example there are no apple stores in caracas  venezuela  all russia 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,while apple doesn’t have as much customization  i do like how they have guidelines or bumpers to keep things looking consistent  with my android  i can make it look however i want  but i’m no designer  apple just makes it look clean without weird edge cases  imo 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what  iphone vs android  what the hell is this title  hardware vs software  aint no way 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ability to support my friends and family   definitely goes to the iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,boooooorinnnnng
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there are also many apps for themes and shortcuts on the iphone  so i personally wouldn’t even give that to android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,still a wrong comparison in my opinion  its like comparing oranges and pasta  compare ios with android  or an iphone with another android device  u cannot comoare a decice with an os 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,face_with_open_mouth  tell me now 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,safety  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,honestly id say ease of use depends what you are trying to do  trying to get to certain settings or do certain things on iphones is mildly infuriating    a lot of stuff in settings is just needlessly buried  and the default browser experience is just utterly painful on iphone if you want to navigate forward or back on webpages and even getting to other tabs is needlessly more complicated than it needs to be 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if its variable what then didnt choose the drow one 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i was   apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if it wasnt because of the apple groopies  that buy an apple product because of fashion  android would be the winner  all of those features amdroid brought to the market apple copy it  they benchmark of each other but apple copies a lot more from android than the other way around 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i find android more easy to use compare to ios for example the file management in ios  its so bad that i have to stop using iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well its just a phone at the end of the day 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,plus iphone has a great camera 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,brilliant video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lol  video  am very happy with my iphone not care about who has more points 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think apple has paid him to win iphone updates and  ecosystem is more good of android than iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think you glossed over software updates a little too quickly and like many people completely missed something pretty big  apple gets  major os updates and has that long term os support yes  but os updates mean way more for an iphone than they do for an android phone  on ios the update from apple updates everything  including system apps and minor feature improvements like offline maps  whereas with android every app is updated via the play store  play services or apk completely independent from major os updates  which means safari will stop getting updates in  years  but chrome can work securely far longer than that since they typically target an api for an exceptionally long time  it’s an important distinction and it’s disappointing that you didn’t mention it at all  because once  years are up on ios updates  that’s it apart from major security patches  whereas the vast majority of your android apps will continue to receive updates far past  years  and the system can still get play services updates such as how nearby share rolled out to any phone running android  or newer 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it really depends on how techy you are  android if you want to design your phone the way you like it  apple if you want to follow the sheeple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the google camera is just so gucci  if the iphone could never 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, ease of use must go for android  how can you go with ios  while there just see the gallary and itunes on laptop and give some random person who never use any of then they will always find ease touse android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one word  utorrent 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,have you considered adding accessibility as a category  because with apple it’s not just that the os has more features  it’s that apps are more accessible by default because of development practices
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,en lo de las apps podría dar el punto para android por el simple hecho de qué hay apps  muchas  que no están disponibles en ios y que facilitan más las cosas en el celular 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,carplay is irreplaceable 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,which model is it  in    
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the reason i could never buy an iphone is   based on the fact that the multitasking capability is basically non existent  the other  is the no back button and no volume control mixer lol 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i tried  and was hopeful mb  i even thought learning some nice things about apple could open my mind but no~ generally thought no shit  finally on android points and oh i dont agree consider it good significant on apple points  i mean some of the ties were no brainers  apples and oranges are round  tie  no one cares   gotta say i feel the loyalty here and not in a good way  objectivity would be cool  still im reaffirmed against apple  sorry comments section  please enjoy my share of apple product  at the end of the day  products are generally worse and fit less categories because duh  the company never really cared 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,imho  updates support go to android  apple has many issues  specially if you own old iphones 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,disagree about the apps  its really tedious to install apps from other regions  e g  china  japan  comparing to android  this is not a issue on mac os  im a mac and android user  i know its a weired combo 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video and good save at the end  i had my pitchfork in hand    android all the way 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me android has a lot to offer no restrictions at all you own your own device
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,uh wtf the quality of this video is insane  did you or youtube change something 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,last android i owned was the note   it sucked so so much i never been back since  worst experience i have ever ever had with a mobile phone… never ever again cause it suxxxxed so muccchhh 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if iphones also have under display fingerprint sensors 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,incredible content as usual 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,cool system  an actual helpful way to work out which one to go with thats pretty neat
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you can’t be making a clickbait video of debating when in the end you’re gonna end up saying they’re both good in their own way
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro  im just like you  i have both ecosystems  apple  and samsung  and when google gets  theres finalised in  ill have them tooo  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for the apps  android completely and uitterly crushes due to the tens if not hundreds of millions of available modifications of apps through third party software  i just couldnt see myself living with a phone where i cant just modify my favorite game to play with others using all the fun and exiting mods or even just simply speeding up progress
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its actually no debate  get the phone you like and keep it moving
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as a developer whos worked on both platforms  there are a few issues here that stand out to me   first is that these categories are all weighted the same  but they are not equal  its called out in the end that its going to be different for everyone  but there are some that are clearly far less important   one of the largest missing categories is safety     of mobile malware comes from the google play store  thats just insane   as much as i hate apples walled garden  its pros outweigh is cons  at least for most people   mobile safari is an absolute pile of garbage and every browser you can get on the app store is just a lightly modified safari  apple wont allow anything else for security reasons   android allows some features that ios refuses to that allows for some great functionality   like how a headless services  light background service that runs regardless of the state of the parent app  can stay running on android  even when you restart the device  loss of battery  os update  etc  where ios forces the parent app to restart   thats a big problem for a lot of ios apps    as for why companies prioritize ios apps  its because people on that platform are more willing to spend money   as much as dealing with all the different os quirks of android sucks  the people who make those decisions dont really care about that  they care about how they make their money and users on ios are more willing to pay   though there are anecdotal situations where the opposite is true   also  the argument for the samsung ecosystem is crazy  because its extremely well known that you never buy anything from samsung that isnt a tv or a phone  as their home appliances are some of the worst made 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i picked up a friends iphone and tried to do simple things that i was able to pick up on android on day  of me having an android phone and i was getting frustrated   my farther got an ipad from the va and they wont let him change his keyboard and the keyboard thats on the ipad  and guessing iphone  is the worst thing ive ever used  horrible  i mean i wanted to throw the thing against the wall bad   so ease of use android wins in my eyes 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,all my friends are iphone  i cant access the shared iphoto album from our vacation together  but i was able to send them everything on gdrive just fine 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me personally the most important feature is how it feels holding it in your hands  i use an iphone  pro because i love the feeling the back of the phone gives you  and i almost don’t care about customisation and most of the stuff
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the apps category should go to android since it supports sideloading around the world 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,totally agree
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as much as i can appreciate the long term support apple provides  their price tags mean that i will never  ever buy anything from them  im already half appalled at myself for buying a phone that cost like € 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when are we getting the to buttons over the apple keyboard  this bugs me so much pro max  big display and they don’t add numbers option over the letters
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,excitement around android  honestly being an android user  im not excited about any android phone  i dont go into market looking for a different design or the most innovative  i think most people go in to find an allrounder   and i think everyone rallies up for iphone launches even for a minimal update  poor analysis 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,on iphone you cant use apps in background 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if i have a macbook  airpods  apple watch  and iphone i’ve bought into an ecosystem then why would i change 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,good video  i love customization  all these little things make your day better 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot one important feature not important for you    its called price  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hi m  can you please do  youtooz  i’m a big fan
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love android  but not being able to get out of sms group texts sucks   iphones dont have that problem
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro still listening to born sinner in  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a little disappointed you didnt mention apks and foss type of apps on android  its a huge reason i stick to android to not be stuck solely or reliant to the google play store
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android gets a native  not whatsapp or something  equivalent to imessage  i’m over there in a heartbeat  i’m a begrudging apple customer because i value convenience   sophistication of texting that much
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think this testing methodology is flawed  you picked the testing categories  knowing you were testing an iphone vs android  bringing in bias 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no foldable iphone this year 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,personally ive been using iphone  galaxy and oppo phones for about yrs now  ive to said that both iphone and android had good points as my own experiences and opinions ya   iphone are good for     phone value     software update usage  thats it   android are good for    affordable    innovations    conveniency  doesnt require wifi at all    camera shots  oppo is best    android phones users benefits  samsung wins 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,except for the software updates and ecosystem  all the other categories goes to android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, and we shall give them bread and circus   wheat bread is apple  white bread is android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont get the apps thing going to apple at all  i sideloaded the app  that is in beta  for the new motor controller on my little electric motorcycle with ease in seconds  do that on an apple and apple will brick your phone if they feel particularly mean that day 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i really want to see a disable app on iphone    why  because sometimes i realy want to disable youtube app and whatsup  messenger  i only use for chromecast youtube app  and whats up i really want to disable when i dont want to comunicate  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,customization  android features  android apps  android excitement  iphone updates  iphone ease of use  iphone ecosystem  android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think android has more apps and is very very easy to use  i have an iphone  and a lot of the time i envy how easy my roommate can do a lot on his samsung that i cant  for me i think most of these comparisons are not fair and always in favour of apple cause i use apple devices and i dont know how people come about these results 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,youre welcome
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,rating phone operating systems but completely ignoring privacy  yeah  sure  i mean its just the one device with camera  microphone  permanent internet connection and all contacts as well as conversations with them you carry around the whole day  why would privacy matter to that device  right   but in my opinion any linux phone takes the crown here  even if we ignore privacy     customization  you can edit  modify  adjust everything  literally  sure  android theoretically offers the same options but then not most flavors of android you get do that    features  anything a computer can do  can be done via linux phone  if your hardware doesnt do it yet  hook the thing up which does via cable  wireless or solder it on your board   no problem    ease of use  yeah  thats a disaster depending on your distro  especially on phones  not gonna lie   next    updates support  it depends what you expect in terms of support  via phone at a company  unlikely   in a forum or wiki answering your questions and helping with niche details  definitely  also you get lifetime updates  whats  or  years down the line in comparison to  as long as theres a guy running a debian server  you get your updates   no problem  and even if that would end  swap out the distribution of linux and continue  id expect that developers die before you are running out of updates    apps  everything on a linux desktop works  many android apps work  most windows apps work and likely more  how well is it designed for mobile usage  that depends on your expectations but it improves every day  i would say android and ios win that category for now    excitement  since a linux phone is really different from anything we have seen in last  years  i would say it wins that easily  but i dont think its an objective category either  but lets say it depends on the user    ecosystem  you can run any app that runs on your linux desktop on your phone and vice versa  you can develop your apps on desktop or mobile either way for all platforms  apps in the stores are typically all foss  free and open source software  which can actually be trusted with your data  every optimization you can get  can be used the day its published online if you want to  theres also no limitation when it comes to compatibility besides drivers  even hardware which is not officially supported is likely to have a working driver built by the community around   so the most issues you will have using a linux phone is  ease of use  and  apps  pretty important to most people but i would say it still wins within those categories  definitely if you would add  privacy  as another category  but then i would also argue those categories do not make a lot of sense to compare them as even  obviously  ease of use  and  apps  matter much more to people than  updates support  i mean  its not even close 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,find my is officially the most useless ineffective inefficient app apple has thus far  the location pin point is always off  it sends locations late  worse still i can’t even set camera settings to take photos of the person that has stolen my phone moreover it won’t even tell me when a new sim card has been inserted into my phone  apple iphone security is a myth  all the security features iphones halve are useless if i can’t retrieve and properly monitor my phone in the case that it is stolen 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung has their own projector which i like
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,that dynamic island is fire 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so after the video  it seems like u have been paid heavily by apple to praise the same  but cracks are getting visible
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  his hand clipped through the wallpaper 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’d be great to see a comparaison of accessibility features  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this dude  i have been watching him for a long time  he always supports apple  he must be getting something under the table
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,even the biggest debate messi vs ronaldo  messi clearly won  is over  but how long will android vs ios debate be settled 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android = freedom iphone = user experience  case closed 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,theres no way you can compare android os and ios  unless you dont know how to use your android phone especially samsung flagship    imagine if iphones had dex mode which is on samsung  it would be blown out of proportion  samsung doesnt even advertise their best features
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,who cares  youre comfortable with one os and staying with it
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i like these videos  however…     some features are too close to call e g  features  otherwise like customisation or ecosystem have a clear winner  therefore giving each a grade or point   would be better    ecosystem and updates go hand in hand  ios vs android isn’t even a competition here  which is why google and samsung change their flagship software every few years e g  google hangout to google meets or samsung having dex which only works on some devices    this video is for people who are   a lot of people like the features excitement of an iphone because apple positions itself as competing with itself and it’s previous models  not the competition  whilst it’s not the way it should be  that’s how people still see it and therefore they’re more excited by the new iphone vs the next samsung    these comparisons are always hard because you’re comparing a single choice iphone  although there’s multiple iphone variants  to multiple androids  or just samsung or google     finally  and most importantly  where is the category for sustainability  which phone lasts longer  which manufacturers older models do you see people using  which is the easiest to repair  sadly this is a race to the bottom imo 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,mfkhd wins
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android >>>
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thing keeping me from usingan ios device more than just a toy is a straight up lack of certain apps   features i use at work and how unfriendly the ui is like why dont you start selecting things by holding or how do you even get a picture to another device if its not on ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"i bought my phone thinking about the software updates  its a motorola one  the first motorola phone in the android one lineup   it was supposed to get  at least   googles own wording   years of patches and  years of os upgrades   in that  year span  i should have got android   im still on android    years after  came out "
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,long story short  the iphone  pro is   the same as the iphone  pro  and the   difference is stuff that android has for  years  they are marketing the new stuff like widgets lol for the new phones  but you can also put them on your iphone  pro look in a few years apple will invent the in screen fingerprint sensor for the iphone  or  pro 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphones are great for old people or kids or not tech enthusiastic people who just want something easy to use  i personally prefer android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what i hate about the native calculator on the iphone is that they cant even delete the numbers  had to wipe out the entire calculations each time i had a typo 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you should add assistant as a category since siri is borderline useless while google assistant helps in everyday tasks a lot
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as someone who has been an android user for most of my life  as a  year old  and switching to an iphone just as of yesterday  i was looking up some videos for the iphone like how to change your ringtone  wallpaper  just customization in general and the yt algorithm did its magic recommended me this video  i would agree with marques and say android does have better customization  you can change the apps that come with the phones icon color like the call button  messaging  etc  a color pallet of the box type thing surrounding the app  the folders  and notifications   iphone just isnt that broad and has been kinding of lacking like how they just having these customization features recently 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the argument for iphones is the eco system  the argument for android phones is cost efficiency  shouldve been part of the discussion    there is no bad product  just a bad price  how can you not feature the price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,very informative thank you so much for this
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think for someone who havent used an iphone will definitely find iphones difficult to use but someone who havent used an android will have lesser difficulty in using an android smartphone  so ease of use should go to android imo  and as you mentioned in the end its really about what you prioritise  for me i prioritise customisation  features  excitement and sideloading apps more than anything else so android is the pick for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,actually the apple s ecosystem and  ease of use  are the reason i dont buy an iphone  i mean  i bought one like two years ago and sold it the next day 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, say what you want  a very nice way to tell people i know you wont agree to what i am about to say

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is a devices and services company first  google is an advertising company first  they have different priorities  for apple  youre a customer  for google  youre a product  that they sell to other companies  apple does some stupid stuff with their devices  and they are overpriced  but in the end they are made for you  the customer  google creates devices so that they can deliver more ads  and slurp more personal information from you to sell 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  whats that 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the app preferences on ios is what made me switch back to apple  despite having a better processor and customization every major app i used would crash constantly and never updated when i had my oneplus t
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i agree with you but i add a categoryskull_and_crossbonesskull_and_crossbonesskull_and_crossbones 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,also if you dont get paid by these companies no need to champion them ive always used samsungs but f k them too lol they a billion dollar company they dont need me to fight for them choose what you want
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for the feature section  does android have shortcuts automation like apple  if it doesn’t  apple is the clear winner for me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,and i agree with iphone being easier to use im an android user but when people ask me i usually just say if you want to mess with your phone and do more with it choose samung but iphone just works lol all the cool features and stuff anyone can use it easily theres not much digging around
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,before i watch this i think hes going to say the real winner is you 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i remember  when i transported from android to ipnone  it was a majestic experience  everything just works without dancing with torches  only iphone since then 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use  yea  but only for us  rest of the world doesn t have problems with that  they understand basic phone control   apple store are not everywhere   maybe in us  but in europe and asia    last argument also  us is not he rest of the world   the world is bigger   and somehow that should win that argument  although  for me  they are in a tie concerning ecosystem   love the vids  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marques mentiones  your  close friends  and i realised there are chances they would considering me weird just for watching this video…
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,of coz this comparison is biased towards iphone  there are so many ways android is way better than ios just depends on the user perspective and the things that matter to them 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think a good category to add is ui  the fact that iphone does not have a universal back button is absolute ass  furthermore  androids back button also works on both the left and right side of the screen making it ambidextrous 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wow gracias primer video q veo q es en ingles y lo traducen al español por lo regular es dar click en el boton de subtitulos y seleccionar español pero no eso realmente te hace estar por encima de los demas no tengo tema si es ingles o español obvio prefiero español pero da igual y no habia visto ningun video asi cuando busco reseñas asi q por eso digo excelente video gracias por compartir dejo mi like buen hombre
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wait  at   when you talk about features that iphone has that android doesnt you mention focus mode  but the pixel series does have a focus mode under the digital wellbeing category in the settings  and as far as deciding which contacts can interrupt you  that is lopped under do not disturb 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is basically lets build the perfect phone + experience for everybody  android is like lets build different phones  different experience so each person can choose their own  this is the main reason i have always been recommending android to friends and family  because i want them only to pay for features and experience they care about and not get locked into a specific mobile experience  i have also recommended iphones for types of friends who post on social media all the time and need a decent enough phone which will most likely not brake  these kind of people have a lifestyle that depends on the phone and therefore the iphone fits in perfectly  iphone or apple products in general are the safest recommendations you can give  so if you dont know or care about the tech or dont know about the needs and wants apple is always the safe choice
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,basically if youre american  iphone  for the rest of us android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  how do you do that 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,do you always use light mode on your phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android all the way
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,personally  i think that apple  for a long time  was indeed very innovative and out of the box  i mean  donald norman  working at apple  conceptualized what we know as user experience  but in the last few years  apple mostly followed the path that other companies paved  taking almost zero risks in testing new markets or technical advancements  just like marques said  think about all the new attempts at folding devices that we are getting from samsung  all the efforts to create high quality vr devices and experiences from vive and meta  to get a device like the vision pro for that price in   its expected that it should be that good  but its by no means new  in many ways  i think apple is straying away from the path of innovation  especially when most of the significant design changes that people actually need are driven by new laws and demands coming from governments like the eu  i just saw a tiktok from this girl saying that apple was genius to feature type c on their upcoming devices  like that was a totally intentional move 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use is not applied  ios anymore   my grandpa got a xiaomi phone and told me it is just like the old iphone ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android team
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the best phone and ecosystem is the one that serves you 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,is it just me or does anybody else notice something with mkbhds left hand during   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,anyone here for the answer           android is better
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you’ve devised a system for us to pick our own winner…  but literally nobody ever wondered which is better  we already have the phones we want lol   why tf should i put your  categories in order and rate them  i’m sorry but that whole bit is just stupid  you really didn’t think things through  probably less than   of your viewers will actually watch this before deciding what phone to buy  unless you’re + years old  you already know your preference 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,fac ceva pe inteligenta artificiala asta a lumii  a avansat prea mult și totuși mai are multe defecte
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone  nevar  variante prea putine  android very cool  samsung  motorola  xiaomi  iphone no
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why android doesnt have the app drawer anymore 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i only disagree on the updates topic  i believe android has many updates for many different devices and if your actual phone doesnt support it you can just buy an intermediate phone that can update or it comes with the new version of android  unlike iphones where you are obligated to buy the most recent device if your old iphone doesnt support it anymore  and in my country they are really expensive 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i used both android and iphone and i will tell which is better each category in my opinion   hardware  iphone   without a doubt iphone has the best cpu and gpu in the market  youll never get lags when you gaming  android is also great as well but in this category  iphone is still dominating   software  android   you can do a lot of customization  you can edit everything from home screen  lock screen  keyboards  etc    camera  id say both are debatable  when it comes to quality of taking pictures  iphone is better but also samsung is also getting better while they have the zoom thingy that you can take a picture of a moon  id say both on this category   battery and charging  android   many android phones have much longer battery life plus many many brands such as samsung  xiaomi  oppo  oneplus  etc have fast charging feature which is amazing    durability  iphone   well they have thick design while many android phones have slimmer design which means if they dropped well its either hit or miss    water dust resistant  both  software updates  iphone   you get updates like every  or  weeks   final conclusion  if you want just a simple and easy phone to use  get an iphone  if you like to do a lot of things such as customization and features  definitely get an android  they are both great phones in their own ways and category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in the usa 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,who is the real winner  ans  that is up to you to decide     another great video by mkbhd  cheers   kudos 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nice video  jersey in the house 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,all of this was great  and it did help me appreciate androids a little more   but  as a total mac universe  the cross connection to all my apple computers and tablets  via icloud  is seamless  flawless  and makes managing my life and saving my photos  makes the iphone the only choice for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ey marques  pls change the languaje translaters of the spanish videos  thanks 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,still no t dialer  still no fixed number row on the keyboard  app settings are still mixed in the settings app  i dont get it  where is the  ease of use 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,struggling for content
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my guess is that over   of phone users arent techies   i no very few who want to customize the phone to any great degree   what they love about apple is that everything apple talks to everything apple   the mac talks to the iphone which talks to the ipad  etc   so  when looking for a phone  first thing to consider is what other devices do you use   thats where i place the greatest weight 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the green light on your head is disturbing
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great framework
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me is apples exosystem a big fat minus point for apple   because this is their way to extort you for their overprized hardware
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would disagree with the  ease of use  it is definitely apple marketing   but if you take an android phone out of the box and do nothing to it  it works like an iphone  my  year old mother had no problems   but updates and support  apple is way ahead   the pixel gets  years only 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,not in the above category but one major thing for me is the price which android wins  the flagships may have similar price  i dont know  but in low end to midrange  android has more choices  i live in the rd world country so price is one of the key deciding factor  thus  its android for me  if apple releases a phone similarly specced and priced as those midranged xiaomi phones  i might just give it a try  but we all know apple wont go that low 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you missed the most important category  the durability  apple products are way more durable than androids 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  they should put this on a tile for psychos 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how about the huawei mate pro  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why do all tech people ignore aesthetic  what if i like the aesthetic of the macbook so i buy it  then i buy an iphone because duh  gaming laptops especially are guilty of this  they make devices that no sane person would carry in public  forgetting that even  hardcore  gamers are just people and they like to have nice things
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,just customization feat will never make me switch to an iphone  i have a few friends and even some coworkers have asked me how come my lock screen looks super cool haha  like  i give it a switch up look every now and then so its always something new  my mom asks me if i got a new phone everytime i do it lol  i love the simple fact that its done my way not the  apple way  as you mentioned 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,interesting that apple won the ecosystem category but that ecosystem only works if theres multiple users inside that ecosystem  also  no mention about how that ecosystem locks out every other user making it far more difficult to communicate or interact with that ecosystem if youre on the outside 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i like android due to freedom however android can be easily hack because once they know your password there is no way to escape  in other word it could be clone  watch who you share your phone with 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,el ecosistema de samsung es increible  para mí el mejor  desde el aparato para buscar las llaves hasta usar la tablet como segundo monitor pasando por el reloj mega integrado 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,totally agree with you
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well explained  bro   thanks
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,let me guess  it is a tie
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one thing he didnt cover in the updates category is the quality of each update and amount of features that are introduced to each update  im not too sure about android because i have an iphone  but ios  runs like dogshit on my iphone x
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,re  customization  apple’s approach is like a homeowner’s association  there to keep your neighbor from parking his car collection in his front yard 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,andriod is better  apple late  now they both have the same design  android got too many users
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,excelente comparación por que dependiendo del usuario que seas la elección es muy poca así que se resumen a cuestión de gustos
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,make a video specifically on ecosystem 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont believe that the recent ios updates should be considered major just because they increment the number after ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i wish ios was a system to be used on android phones    apple is getting lazy with innovation
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it should say  android  vs  ios    saying  iphone  is like saying  galaxy  or  xperia   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you can facetime an android user  i did not know that 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what is the best android smartphone  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the question is this   if you had both phones   which would be your main phone and which would be your backup 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is good but boring
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,spotted mkbhd listening to graduation
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android google maps are piece of shit but work very very good in  ios apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive been using android all my life  that is for the last  years  was almost certain i was going to purchase an iphone this year but google pixels stock android gave me second thoughts and i prefer android over ios but thats me  this is just a personal preference and has got nothing to do with ios being poor or anything  they both have their share of merits and you cant go wrong with either  the only regret i have is not being able to buy the series of nokia phones they had in the early to mid s 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,root
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,focus mode is also on android  at least samsung has it too 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,mkbhd already using iphone  pro max
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,we all know there is absolutely zero  cool factor  in owning an iphone  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,change phones a fair bit  and switch between the two  but iphone design is old now and boring  oppo find x pro atm  loving it  as never had an oppo previously  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you know damn well the excitement dose not go to android  that was a reach…   mk we all know damn well you don’t believe that  i’ll tell you how you know this is not true  all you need to do is look at youtube view  let a new android phone drop  the apple views will be way higher  it don’t matter  but it’s not true 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hey  cheesy as it is  i like the ending  competition breeds innovation 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my new samsung has the different focus modes and is far more advanced with its customisation than my partners new iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well i choose android because we didnt use facetime  imessage and mac  and some feature from samsung laptop can work well in other windows laptop  but sometimes you need cmd for installation for bypass windows store  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,suggest to add one more category  security 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no security and privacy category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if there is no definitive winner  then why are youtubers making videos like these  sigh
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,but still none of reviewers are bothered about screen issues coming in both iphone and android phones
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,tech has been widely improved and mobile phones are fooling us every year but i am too much annoyed when i take picture and it doesnt impress me alot   i am not much iphone user but my friends are and   my  old sony ericson has ahsamed many highly hyped samsungs  and once i had  not well known  name phone  vivo  during birthday party of a  friend they  left their iphone  and use my vivo to take photo particulaly selfie   camera is a big go for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there is no question why you are the gretest and honest reviewer  thanks and keep up with the best work   no offense michael and others 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i always try to explain to people that this is a stupid question  because there is no clear answer  taking outside of context or a specific user  as you explained at the end of your video  if you are someone that just wants to use a phone for send some messages  call and maybe send a picture over whatsapp  you are fine with a  euro android phone  which is new  an iphone would just be way overpriced  old and used  it also greatly depends on what apps you want to use  i really like pokemon games  i own many different gameboy  gba and ds games as hard copies but don`t want to drag the hardware with me  i would therefor never want an iphone since i cannot play those games on it  via regular apps and without jailbreaking  in fact i think that for almost anyone an android is a better choice in which you scale the price  but if everyone around you has an iphone  it can be easier to also own an iphone  same goes if you own a mac already  it just intergrates better together  there is not set answer to this question 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,missing an important category  repairability 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so sad for symbian  this could have been a  way choice this whole time 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,that ease of use category was put there just so apple could win the split  we all know little kids and grandparents love how easy it is  you couldve easily nitpicked things to put android over the iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hello mkbhd   good comparison video between the two phone operating systems android and ios   generally speaking  all this comes down to personal preference for either side   im an android user and my choice would be android   in addition to what was mentioned in this video about customization and features on the android side  another advantage for android is there are more phone devices to choose from   if you want a regular smartphone  mid range phone or foldable phone  android has those   also  android has faster wired battery charging and has wireless charging   as for mobile payment systems  the advantage is android   samsung pay now being known as samsung wallet and google pay now being known as google wallet  both mobile payment systems gets accepted at more locations than apple wallet  formerly known as apply pay     if i were to make a comparison video between these two phone operating systems  i would include two more categories besides the seven mentioned in the video   in total  itll be nine     category      devices to choose from  people decide on which phone to get based on the availability for devices to choose from   same thing with automobiles and other major things people buy     category     mobile payment systems   as we all know digital payments being made for in person purchases has been on the rise   each year that comes by more and more people are putting it into effect   instead of getting involved in a wrestling or boxing match trying to find cash or debit card credit card  people just grab out their phones from their pockets or purse and just pay that way for whichever items they want to buy   so  between samsung wallet  google wallet and apple wallet  which one of those would be better   well  my phone is a samsung phone so as for me im going with samsung wallet   due to overall flexibility  if i want i can activate google wallet  but im not going to do that 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,we should also consider the security  we use so many mobile banking application nowaday  in my country  so many people got hacked and drained money from their accounts    of victims got hacked via android phone  its not the phone false  hacker uses social enginering to fool the victims to enable app installation from outside google play store  fool victim to go to the fake google play store and install app that share screen  give remote control  register to fake app and create new pin id which normally will be the same as pin id that we use in other apps  etc  anyway  it can be done because android allow that  with this  i have trust issue with android    and also from bloatware that cannot be deleted  some even come with ad and auto update  and each phone try to force us to use thier own app stores and cloud services  we will be asked to create samsung id  oppo id  xiaomi id and so on  changing phone form one brand to another is so annoying in android world  in my dad phone  even i blocked app installation  it is got so many bloatwares update and ads  now he can no longer access the phone setting to delete those apps because there will be ads after ads after ads    iphone also got something similar to bloatware garage band  ituneu   tips  tv  etc  that i dont use  but i still feel save because it just be there and not cause any issue  while storage cleaner  battery saver  voice control app and many more in android always come with ad and keep pop up again and again even i already disable them

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,maybe its time to include harmonyos into the comparison  the new chip in matepro and the   update means harmonyos have completely separate itself from android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i believe the fact that threre is no price value catogary really doent give justise to andriod phones  eco system is literally barely a thing for many phones and only samsung and iphone stand out

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one of the big features why i love iphones is the way you switch from old iphone to new one  all of the photos  apps  contacts  notes  settings  etc carry over seamlessly to the new device  even every app you had will be installed on the same exact spots they were on  you dont have to worry about missing anything  it will be all there  it saves so much time and work its amazing 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,slow day  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,side loading is such an important aspect of owning an android phone that it just cant make me switch to iphone  you didnt even considered mentioning it at all 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hey bro i am from bangladesh
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,where’s is security in your category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would argue with  ecosystem  category  just because its harder to control specific things and how they behave  its more like everything or nothing
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think mbhd wanted a fat paycheck so he made the most milktoast video ever 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,cant you just run a dual boot os  they both have same physical ui   sensors
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro forgot about budget 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you replace ecosystem with gatekeeping  it is not a positive point for apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me  a good apps should be able to communicate with other devices and other brands  not lock me in one ecosystem 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its so shocking  that only  things can  make a difference of a lifetime 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why people say iphone vs android instead of ios vs android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bang for buck  contest over 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,man  i would happily pay a subscription service to apple to have imessage on android  just to get my friends to stop complaining
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the iphone ecosystem is top tier—let’s be honest 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i liked the way you described  ease of use  part  which is the reality as majority of people are not tech enthusiast and prefer to stay intact with the same set of designs and use    as i use both the devices widely  would like to add further that android wins in ease of use even for tech enthusiastic people as they blend smoothly with windows linux or any other hardware  whereas there are hell lot of restrictions and challenges when someone use iphone with a windows or linux as they pushes you to build up the entire set of devices to apple ecosystem  hope   ease of use  works for this too   also a drawback for android  ease of use  is that due to wide variety of devices   brands and different software agreements with each one  it’s hell lot fragmented and there is a challenge of software hardware sync match  this never happens with ios and iphones which definitely the major usp for apple devices 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there is one single feature i use multiple times a day on my phone and no matter how hard i want to switch to the iphone  i cant  that is clipboard  allows me to copy many things and paste them selectively as i wish  on android it is seamless 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i went to apple because google is getting way to intrusive  they want all your data   all your internal memory so you have to buy google storage  its ridiculous
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung system data is  gb  so out of  you get gb of memory  that is non removable apps  apple at least uses only  to gb for system data that is unremovable  my s was half full just from stock installed apps that i am not allowed to remove 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i switched to iphone a long time ago because im tired of customizing my android phone to look like iphone ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ending was cheese mk 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, put the pitchforks down  lol  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i stopped watching when ecosystem category came 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why for the love of god will they not allow me to make sub folders in my photos
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there are way more more free apps on android with a full version features compared to apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this android vs ios debate video  mkbhd does it better 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well good for consumer now but watching teens tribalise over a messaging service and the knock on sociological issues that come with that and the parents  care takers who are expected to take that financial burden for their childs well being well time for the channel to start growing up and embedding those things in to the review process  no    not to mention a matured product on the either side of the ecosystem needs to start kicking in to clean up the massive e waste mess that has accumulated since this all kicked off in   youre growns up now  start cleaning things up for the next generation and be happy we have some amazing interaction capability   that is you the review ecosystem im speaking too  needs to grow up from entertainment factor to engaging in other social qualities 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,where is gaming 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i really felt it when he said  look at your five closest friends 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,sad to see that sideloading apps wasnt mentioned 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,resubscribed  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the biggest elephant in the room that wasnt on your list as a standalone category is [security]   iphones security updates supercedes all other categories  customization be damned  protect my phone from malicious actors  ill live without a specific hardware interface or a x camera 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the reality is  its apple vs samsung  the only good version of android is samsungs one ui version and that really is the best ios android comparison  people with iphones hate android because theyre used to seeing the other shitty versions of android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im a little older than gen z so i havent really had any issues with getting  green bubble shamed  but a lot of the features i use in android that make my life easier really arent available on ios  since im a phd student i need to manage a lot of files and ios clunky approach to file management is pretty annoying when on my android i can basically just use it as a portable hard drive  i might not get air drop but thats really not that big of a deal for me personally 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is a brilliant video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video but wheres security 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,every time i use an android device  i want to throw it out the window   hence  work phone   android  vs personal phone    iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so it is no winner of who is the best and great video man  ]
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lets gooooooooooooooooooo
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android   has sound profiles 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i don’t care i have both 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,first  android the rest  iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you establish android to be daring and able to try all why would i care that they try new things im more exited for iphones
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is always about customization  that already and automatically means that it wins in features and excitement as well 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great job 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you really want to know the difference between ecosystem  by an android phone and iphone  then buy another product of pc  then connect the your phone to the pc let see the one that works  then you can actually chose your ecosystem from there   i guess u cant connect your apple watch with android watch   who has ever send or receive file by using bluetooth on iphone  lemme see your hands up
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the last time that an android phone was actually competing with iphone was pixel xl  then come to find out that the battery was junk so the phone wouldnt last more than  years  the hardware of an iphone is unmatched by android  my jailbroken iphone  pro max  even being on ios  is still more stable than my pixel  work phone or any samsung ive had before that on their current software versions  the dynamic island is a gimmick and people ate it up so no im not just an apple fan boy  simply put  nobody on the android side has made anything to really compete with the experience i continue to have with my jailbroken iphone  pm 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ek jamana tha mkbhd ka ab ye chutiya ho gaya hai ya shayad indian tech youtubers are getting better  bekar and ghatiya comparison 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i bought iphone and ditched after  months  i find it lacks so many basic functionality which my android was having for years 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i just recently switched to iphone just because of the crash detection and satellite emergency messaging   my biggest complaint with apple is that i cant customize the home screen   for crying out loud apple let me customize the home screen the way i want  not the way you want 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,danny duncan should watch this
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what a surprise american guy  gives a win to american company
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use should have included accessibility as a bullet point  changing font icon sizes etc would be key points for the older folks out there 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,updates support  you definitely overlooked fairphone here  ^^
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,where does battery life fall in in this system  features  ease of use  apps or customization given androids ability to switch between screen refresh rates 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,theres focus mode on my xiaomi mobile
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, apple ecosystem  is the dumbest thing ever created by apple and his defenders  they are just trying to hold you in  blocking your iphone or making it difficult to connect to non apple devices  the android is an ecosystem  all android devices are compatible  all android devices can share or connect in some way   i can use my samsung smartwatch  my pixel phone  my jbl earphones  my xiaomi tablet and all of them can be connected to my pc  my laptop or any other pc    android is an open world full of possibilities  we are not locked inside a brand  we can choose what we want and what we like  the android has the same apps and features but they are not locked  we can use them on android  windows or linux ^^
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video i really enjoyed it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,only young enthusiasts like android     we mature adults like reliability which android phones often lack    i left android because my samsung  edge plus was defective  the replacement was defective in the same way     the second replacement  all from samsung had a defective battery    it was out of warranty     as a result  i bought an iphone   iphones work    from the  to the  i have never had a problem   by the way  my samsung watch was defective    samsung tablets are poor   you dont keep a device long enough to test reliability which is a glaring omission in your category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i just love the apple iphone user interface  first android i ever had with the great mini tablet nexus   liked it a lot but i was so much happier when i switched to my first apple  an air   it was like i had used it for years  my business is all apple with a little pc here and there  it’s ease of use for me means i’m never going to care how great android gets 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would give ease of use to android  because you basically said that if you want a phone that stays basic and doesnt change use iphone lol  that sounded like a negative to me  and then its also a huge red flag that you are confirming that they keep their phone the same  but raise prices continuously every year with no changes   for updates and support you didnt give a good reason  i literally get updates like every month for my android phones  and what iphone user still has their phone from   hell who keeps a phone past   years  in the majority  so not sure about that category  but maybe that category is just a tie at this point because im not familiar with iphones updates  although ive heard plenty of people claim that phones slow down around new releases to force them to buy a new phone   i also wish you added in the camera  because thats a lot of iphone users excuse  while they are not photographers and just use the simple auto mode  ive seen so many videos  some from you  where android flagships  beat iphones  i would also say that the buzz of the iphone ecosystem here in the us is actually extremely toxic and cult like  people will bully you for not having an iphone  girls will choose to not date you for not having an iphone  i had a friend tell me i should get an iphone because she doesnt like my green bubbles lmfaoooooo  like i dont think i would give iphone a point for that type of behavior tbh  iphone has singal handedly created a judgmental environment when it comes to phones  even just all apple products  someone tried to clown me because i didnt have a macbook  all the while i have an asus zenbook pro with two screens and not some little bar the macbook had
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,whether your  or  both know how to use an iphone  p
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’m an apple user  ease of use i will give android  first time android is more about common sense  the first time apple needs to learn 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is far superior
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,get and apple and you never going to eat it  you dont own the device that you pay for  apple owns it and you pay top   for rent 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,better and easy file management for ios will make apple devices 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,really enjoyed ur vid  keep uploading bro  we like how u make everything detailed
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you missed st party repair costs and rd party ease of repairability 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios straight up sucks compared to android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for consumers to be winners there needs to be more than two competing companies  ios vs android  phone market is mature and into the oligopolic stage  at this stage consumers get products that do not have replaceable batteries and have a predetermined  short  useful life 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hey mkbhd  i need that apple wallpaper bro 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i really missed some android features but right now im scrolling instagram over iphone  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,focus mode is present on android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i just have one problem i prefer samsung but am a gamer and can choose between ipad or samsung tablet
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone wins
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wheres the droeloe track
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is the best phone  thats why they are the no  in the world
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its impressive that apple only wins in the us  the majority of countries dont have apple stores and the people usually dont cara about facetime and imessage  whatsapp is used around the globe
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you compare the functioning of apps between ios and android   i go more often to set stuff in android and go back to ipad  so what makes ios apps better  or all apps on ipad more inferior than on an iphone  the last question i can’t answer 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nah  this is the best ive seen  still an android tho
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple ecosystem  software stability  software updates and ease of use are the only things ios win over android  other than that  android is better but android hardware kind of mixed bag when considering chinese phones  huawei  xiaomi  oppo  vivo etc  have their own accessories and ecosystem that is not working as intended when pairing with other phone accessories from other brands even though these devices running on the same os  if android take an example from microsoft  every hardware made for android will work on multiple devices from different manufacturers
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  [ ] customisation    [ ] features    [ ] apps    [ ] excited    [ ] updates    [ ] ease of use    [ ] ecosystem 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,strongly doubt that any longtime android or ios user will care about your opinion and switch to other platform  so this video is just pure entertainment  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when apple makes a flat screen tv   a washer   dryer   refrigerator   folding pocket and tablet phone   i would say that they have the best ecosystem   samsung has everything apple has plus these items   sorry   there is no ecosystem comparison  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,pienso que el vendadero android de referencia debería ser samsung pues paso a ser el mejor exponente de  android  y aunque muchos no se den cuenta  es más configurable de nivel de personalización que los pixel  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,clickbait title like the usual in these topics

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you know  to me the ecosystem actually scores negative  i hated itunes  i hate all the ways apple tries to prevent me from just cooying what i want to the file system  so thats a minus  for me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,feels like this video has been made a million times

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hey marques  awesome detailed video however it sounds more like the video talks more about how americans view vs the rest of the world view 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the only problem i can say on android phones especially pixel phones is that their app icons are very bad in their appearance they look like old tablets which support android jerry bean  thats embarrassing for a nice phone like a pixel to have such icons 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot to add a  value  category  android has a huge advantage in cost options 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,imessage is only important to americans  everyone is different and ipone and android both exist and honesly there both great for different people 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if i got money  i go bothside  if i dont have money  i go android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think your conclusion is wrong   apple mobiles and accessories costly than android   android is easy to use because of customisation as per once preference    as for app you side load many apps which are not in play store   generally people buy or change phone after   yrs of usage  for better and latest hardware  is there point in long term updates   in android phone has varities of accessories at various price for various users whereas apple product are costly to repair and to replace them
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nothing new just apple user promoting his iphone as they always do
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one thing that makes me regret my android to iphone switch is no work profile support on ios  how can that be missing in current day and age    also not naming imessage a gatekeeper in eu seems kind of strange to me as i switched to iphone especially due to the fact my closest family uses iphones and it was  too much  for them to rich text with me with other rd party apps 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this videos are jokes  but really  we are in   and i can not do on iphone half of things i can on for example samsung  iphone is left far behind 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how is this the final verdict 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my problem is that with android your experience wildly differs  i am on a pixel  pro right now so i am getting both the latest and greatest updates and the cleanest version of android  this is not the case with large parts of the android world  i am for example not a fan of the way samsung changes android  some of the changes can be undone  e g  by installing a launcher  but some cant  many cool features  e g  the magic eraser  are pixel only right now  this is where ios is better  if you do go for android because of this video  keep in mind that many things that were named here only apply to pixel phones  theyre great  but if you go for something like an oppo phone  you wont get these things 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,now no one can say that they have  upgraded  from android to ios it does not make sense 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,let’s be honest  for the time being we’ve never had it so good  if you’re able to treat yourself to a higher end smart phone  you can’t make the wrong choice  they’re all exceptional  regardless of manufacturer  thanks for the video pal 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i wish you have talked about international support  because iphone is every where and the g work in most of the word like if you travel a lot   but some android phones not available in many countries and if you bay it from outside you well have issue with connectivity g    that made me switch to iphone after  years of being android user  google phones  thanks
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the best solution is to jave both  for daily use i prefer ios and for some special moments i use android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,to keep price out of this is crazy
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,having been an android guy since the inception isandroid while using an ipad because its simply better than any android tablet imo i have to disagree about ios winning in the apps category for two reasons     there are many ios applications which do not work on the ipad correctly and display on phone mode     having the ability on android to sideload applications is so very important for many reasons i wont go into here   that said i will give the nod to ios application quality for some of the apps i use  they seem to be better optimized for ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios easy to use  i used the google search to find out so many things  why is the camera settings in the system settings and not in the camera app  how to just disable the  call missed  sound like on android   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think the video is very biased to ios  if we talk about ease of use  definitely the android is much easier to use because here we can do the customisation according to our need    in terms of apps  android is unbeatable  if we consider these pov  developer  developing android app is much easier than ios business  because of android’s open platform it is very simple to list the app on playstore for any business  user experience  apps work much better in android than the ios and also the point you made  updates are coming to ios first is totally wrong  i never see this thing  every time update first come to android     ecosystemsmiling_face_with_smiling_eyes 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,yes  team iphone wins again 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,cmon marques  you literally cant say that apple is genuinely easier to use over android  i guess in the echo chamber that is apple ecosystem in the us led to this conclusion  but apples ease of use is horrible  horrible  to anyone who has never used an iphone or ipad before  heres a challenge  take an android tablet and an ipad to middle aged users whove never used tablets before  and see who can get setup and going faster with the basics  mail  youtube  netflix etc   then  take an android phone to an iphone user and an iphone to an android user  and see who can get running faster  lastly  you forgot the  most important criteral     cost of ownership and price    reparability  apples a cult  android is an ecosystem  and a dying cult at that  apple revenues have been going down for past  years  while googles have reversed the losses and going up 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this guy is super  he gave a happy ending to the pros and cons 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a girl in the us unmatched me on bumble because i didnt have imessage 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,latest versions of ios requires a   iphone and if you dont have the latest and greatest ios x to  will be the same
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love idevice updates because they make my device better by forcing me to buy a new one  not an issue ive had on my sfe g
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marques   iphone is the winner  me  picks up the pitchfork  marques   but but  me  reluctantly puts the pitchfork down 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you made a lil error focus mode is on android under digital well being
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,just a quick point on apps  you’ve made very good points  but one bit that i think a lot of people miss  is that older versions of android still support newer versions of apps  i’ve got an ipad mini  from a million years ago  but basically none of the apps on the app store can be installed on it  meanwhile my oneplus  has been out of date for at least  years and still gets every app update and can use the entire app store suite of apps  minus a few  that’s a huge draw imo   also i don’t think ecosystems is really that close  google’s ecosystem is cross platform  so apple gets all that compatibility and i don’t really think samsung’s ecosystem is that comparable to apple’s  i hate apple’s walled garden and ecosystem restrictions  so i hate that ecosystem  but credit where credit is due  they’ve done a very good job with it
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,best use both phone  android and apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nice work

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how can google destroy apple instantly  stop all google apps on ios  chrome  maps  ios depends on google apps but android doesnt need ios apps  the end
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you missed one important point regarding durability  it can be  trusted that iphone will run atleast  years without any hardware problems  still i love android  because who gonna use same phone  years 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there is a category that android wins easily  price
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple stores so rare in lithuania  some even get closed  and we in europe  im afraid to buy iphone also because its impossible to repair and also after buying € smartphone i also would need to buy separately a new charger for around € from th party  dot know aple prices  and usually with android phones in lithuania u would get smart  watches or wireless headphones   mostly with samsung  so no point in buying apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,customization and file management will forever be what keeps me on android  given i doubt apple will budge on either of those things  i like having the ability to whatever i want with my phone way too much 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,good take
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love  mrwhosetheboss
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the winner is the galaxy s ultra 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nice episod  sir  very well explained  at the end of the day  its just technology   and for the most part  technology sucks 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the problem with his take on android features is they are not os features  you have to buy certain phones to certain things like reverse charging  this vid should be either ios vs android or samsung vs iphone vs google   he bounces between android and just samsung 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bs video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,andorid for ease of use and software  apple for camera and ecosystem    saves you a watch
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marques  you missed a big one  speed  the newest galaxy benchmarked against the iphone   regular iphone   the iphone  was x as fast as the galaxy  currently the iphone  pro max is available
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,such a well done video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,theres no mention of  value  most folks have a budget and will consider the cost benefit ratio to any purchase 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wait the trash can mac is a plant pot   loll
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i feel like customization and features are to similar to be two separate categories
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i appreciate the objectivity it is very much a personal preference thing   a couple of points i wanted to add is that app variety and cost should be considered   there have been multiple occasions where ive told my friends about a cool app that was free on android that costs money on apple  its almost like shopping on amazon and at walmart compared to stores at the local mall   android wins on flexibility and cost  the second point is the cost in general  hardware and accessories   apple has made inroads in affordability  but android has so many options and continues to be the leader in options for everyones budget 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,correction  it is android os versus ios or better said open source linux versus lockdown freebsd 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nobody could tell hes an apple fan boy  brilliant job
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,closed the video after iphone won at the app category
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hit like for android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use and app optimisation is for iphone and thats their power service including the consistent updates
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great iphone vs android video and relevant categories that apply to me   you helped me decide what phone i buy next  iphone  apps  updates and ease of use are my priorities   thanks 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well that was  minutes i shall never get back
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the ecosystem is so bad for apple  if you dont want to have another apple product like a mac book then your ecosystem is broken   example an architect would never consider a mac  if you have i phone and want to be part of that ecosystem well then its over for you  the end   apples ecosystem is more like a straight walking trail than an actual ecosystem
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,people who can not buy the latest phone  will go for android  because that´s what they can afford   so  there are so many users that don´t care about any of these features  they just want a phone for whatsapp and call and how much money they can spend on something that gives them those two things 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the app one i dont aggre you can  sign up for beta and get new updates and you cant show foldables apps like that without showing ipad apps brother
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its weird he did not talk about privacy at all  because of that thing alone i would iphone is the winner 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think for ecosystem it would have been interesting to mention that android is made by google and thus receives some integration benefits with the google ecosystem  one of my favorite features of my phone is that any google app i open automatically knows all three of my accounts and lets me quickly switch between them  still think apple wins in that head to head but thought it was worth mentioning
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot price  first category above all 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,u r an apple guy  its not a general thing  its your own notions and your love for apple devices which basically requires the customers to pay the value of their body organs 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,sorry my man  but you screw this one up  its either android vs ios or [phonebrand] vs iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i still prefer windows phone     p s   what is that wireless charging stand he is using        i need that    i found it  its a belkin charger 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i like both 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  ios ui is ugly
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the easier answer is that if you are someone who uses your phone exclusively for social media and pictures videos then an iphone is for you  for everyone else the android is your choice 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have google pixel and an ipad  my ecosystem
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,fairphone  is the update winner 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android   wins for apps to me solely because of apks being accessible
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphones separate setting app drives me nuts im tech support for my father   fine  for general settings for the phone  but for the individual apps too   it honestly doesnt make sense when the conventional wisdom is settings for x the variable  not twitter screw you elon  app are within said app   just look at windows  linux  even android  you wouldnt go to windows settings to change something about firefox or chrome  same goes for all the oss unless its something special and more os specific 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone  to much password needed thats is disqualified for me  next complicated use am not understand iphone  third not free app  and important thing not removable battery  to much useless suggestion on iphone  twice iphone flight to river  am trying many times to learning this phone and frustrated me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the deciding features were arranged to make android look like it would win  just like the nigerian election was set
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,price is not even mentioned 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my number one criteria for selecting a smart phone is security   im surprised it didnt make the list 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,your videos are top notch my friend 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,loving the backdrop in this video  color wise everything looks so full and rich without distracting from the main focus 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my big issue is that android feels free and full control but everything doesn’t work nicely with each other… iphone everything feels premium with restrictions but imessages beats androids rcs
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my winner is android  specifically  samsung  but i have an s ultra and an iphone se  i dont care about ecosystem but like mkbhd  i feel the best decision is hybridization  best of both worlds 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the winner is iphone and its honestly no argument  the facts that it’s iphone against the whole android ecosystem and not iphone vs google or iphone vs samsung speaks to the supremacy iphone is  iphone vs any other  phone brand is always gonna be a clear winner
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot the price   a big win for android phones where you have lots of budget options 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,spoiler alert  the answer is  the friends weve made along the way  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,we are groot 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,huh  i wish someone could do an honest comparison  your bias is obvious 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use  camera launch of power button on samsung is exigent  android wins 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wait what  how can you join a facetime from am android phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,at the end  what matters is money  the battery…… and who pastes the apple logo…  nothing else matters 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i miss a big point by customization  there is also customization outside of the phone which might be important for some people as well  most brands  when they sell anything regarding phones  they think about the iphone first  you can e g  find any kind of cases for iphone  only samsung can compete with that and not every android user likes samsung  there are so many cool gadgets made for iphone specifically 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,title should be android vs ios  not iphone vs android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a camera section would’ve been great to add as well
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple was the inventor of glued batteries in smartphones and notebooks  all android and windows manufacturers followed like lemmings  i used to always be able to change the battery in my htc  samsung  lg  etc  even in my windows notebooks  from an ecological point of view alone  apple gets two minus points  a disaster  see ifixit  a good  ecological alternative is the fairphone   but slow   heavy  greetings from green germany  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dexx +usb power bypass charging =pc+phone=apple death phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i want to literally flip to the other side  z flip  to be exact 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i use iphone pro max and galaxy  most of the time use galaxy  reading on iphone is horrible  on galaxy it is crystal clear 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,shouldnt the ease of use category be given to android  apple has everything complicated whereas android has everything easy going and its even easier for someone to figure out something to do in android rather than in an apple device 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,recycled idea for video lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot the price category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,me who is using both pixel  pro   iphone  pro  android for regular use   iphone for official use  my personal winner is android  cause the environment is so advanced   pixel is doin great 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone vs android is the real world war 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,he sounds like a  year old girl   who hates that one android boy outside of america   no one cares for facetime or imessage i believe in europe people use whatsapp and china they use wechat  and in india people use whatsapp again  and i just showed you the biggest dynamic of people outside who dont care for these blocks on the road that apple creates
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  at this point  it’s only ai tweaks to make to make either one better     iphone  will have usb c
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its a good thing that your ratings are very subjective 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the winner is them  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,can someone tell iphone to make it where when recording a video you can pause it and then come back to start where you left off eliminates a lot of editing
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,isnt the video title sort of misleading  iphone is a phone whereas android is an os 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,zero day attack vulnerability will be a good point of comparison here 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use to iphone  have you ever tried to get photos off of an iphone  they literally make it impossible  so you pay for icloud 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,also  google apps being better on iphone  is that why you cant use google maps while your phone is locked on iphone meanwhile you can on android  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android phones
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,love how you left out rd party apps  you know the thing iphone cant even fucking do unless its jailbroken  i dont know if that term in relevant anymore but yea  and android we can download what ever fuck we want  honestly the choice is easy android trumps iphone  big tech youtuber doesnt show a portion of the facts nice to know everyone a fucking apple fanboy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think app is a toss up  there are things that are straight out not possible on iphone  granted not a very common application like turning my android phone into a pc loud speaker  or play bit perfect audio via the usb c port  but those  are  functionalities i use every single day with my good ol galaxy s   id say for someone who uses their phone purely as a phone  the iphone is the way to go  for anyone who wants more functionalities out of their phone  iphone isnt gonna cut it and youll find so many good things on android that makes your life much better 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have one iphone  one android tablet and one android phone  both are good  i use both for different task  life is good
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android programmers taking notes at the moment
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think another important category to include in your decision is security privacy  personally i really appreciate the safety feeling apple devices provide 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,spotify and snapchat updates suck so hard on android  i swear they dont test updates before pushing them 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i copy a text on my iphone and cmd v on my macbook and it paste  im constantly doing this  especially for school   im not sure how android is but the seamlessness of my apple products and how they all work so well with each other is the reason i can never switch 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i will use android forever
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,exciment there is no way android get that  we haven’t see people forming in lines days before to buy a any android phone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i can plug a usbstick into my android phone  move files around  plug in a mouse or a keyboard even  listen to fm radio  fiddle around with professional nfc cards  and probably more stuff i forgot  all this for a fraction of the price   there should be a section for freedom and bang for buck    americans are big on freedom and saving hard earned money  but then love paying hundreds for their iphones and walled gardens  it doesnt make sense  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone   device android   operating system  can´t compare these   can you  did you mean ios vs android    of the world uses android so there´s really not much of a debate  i advise you to escape that usa bubble once in a while 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think its also worth mentioning other ecosystems like googles  which is also very respectable  and also that other ecosystems instead of building a wall arround their users  some of them even let you and help you get in and out of them  for example google contacts  you can import and export your google contacts
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the updates and support thing is also something  you can technically run android  on pretty much any smartphone if you know what youre doing 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android all day  use macs for all my desktop needs but despise ios  my wife and all my kids have the latest and greatest iphones and anytime i grab one to do the simplest of task  call  look at a web page  try to go back  i end up just wanting to chuck it out a window 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,do one with huawei vs pixel vs samsung vs iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,and what you completely forgot for number two is that if there is a feature on android that you want but its not there  someone probably made some kind of app or something to make it exist  or  you could even do that yourself  so softwarewise android is kinda infinetly customizable
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a lot of people mentioned sideloading on android  which is true  but i would also like to point out the very america centric view of the mobile os divide in this video  in europe  you cant prioritize ios over android in app development  in fact  push comes to shove  and you would have to entirely give up on one of them  it would make more sense to drop the ios app then the android app  since the android market is much larger and dropping the android one would effectively mean the death of your app   i now in the us its the other way around  but the us isnt the whole world 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple stores everywhere  maybe in the usa  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love this guyyy
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about account set up and entry from 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i am working in it and i would say apple has way more features  offcourse you can basically program android how you like but from what they ship  apple has more features    also you are comparing exclusive samsung stuff to apple but that doesn’t make sense in an android against ios video
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thanks for this video  you made me realize every reason to use an ios is as shitty as my poop from yesterday  i found iphones to be boring and overpriced  its dumb to compare   phone to a   phone and then distributing points  you can literally get  androids at the price of one iphone and they all work flawlessly 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’m surprised you didn’t mention privacy and security
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in us  iphone  outside  android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im very close to switching from android to apple because im really fed up with the ecosystem on android  also the amount of thought google puts into their flagship devices  e g  pixel watch  is underwhelming
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,good to know apple finally got rid of the bloatware  couldnt hide or delete apps  so id end up putting them in a folder called crapp  used to be + apple branded things that clogged up the look feel memory  even if only slightly  i think a major factor for me is also price  for most of the past decade  i could get a oneplus with all or almost all of the features of a flagship iphone samsung for a third of the price  even if i loved apple  i also need that money for other things   so it was never going to win while their phones cost upwards of  cad  in many cases 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it is impossible to choose one  each is different  android phones are more affordable than iphones and thats the only difference  of course i am not talking about flagships which are overpriced on both sides  you can buy a mid range android phone while for the same price you will get a  years old iphone  the apple ecosystem is where people lose a lot of money due to the way they built the system 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the hidden th category is the one that decides it for most people  price
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,by the time the updated ios comes for the phone that was launched  years ago it will make it unusable 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the real winners are those who realise their current phone is still working and they dont need to waste their time and money for a few more megapixels 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,side loading  custom roms for android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dnd on ios declines calls  people think you are hanging up on them which is aweful
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nice video  this is kind of the same way i family and friends choose there phones and laptops  like do you like to see all your photos on your phone and tablet at the same time  do you like to buy in  years a new phone  do you like fiddling with settings  and surprisingly when i am a real android fan  i allot advice apple divisies to family and friends course they dont know how to fiddle with android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is what you wanted   marques on yt rewind
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the difference is that one is the bad one and the other one is not
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the main reason i went to android is because back in highschool during the recession people kept stealing my apple products
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if i could use huawei in the us i’d go back to android  prefer iphone until then
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,clearly explained and got some knowledge regarding the subject     thank you very much
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i really want to buy a fold… but my main issue is that everyone i know  family and friends  use an iphone  meaning i would be left out on imessage  facetime and such features…   second  the ecosystem is also important to note here for me  as said in the video… i use a mac for work  a mac on a private basis  an ipad  apple tv and sometimes i also wear my apple watch for exercise  i have a grand seiko for daily driver  this means that the samsung would not play ball with all my other devices thanks to apple  i would have to either live without those benefits of continuity  hand off  typing in stuff from the phone on the apple tv and so on  and i am not sure i am able to give that up because it gives me such ease of use in my daily life  saving me so much time 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android has better file management and you can use some  unconventional apps  for specific  reasons  just by that android is superior
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i v changed to iphone  while i m still having the galaxy s  and i can confirm that the galaxy is much pleasing to use  to hold and customise  the only part that i m happy with for the iphone is the battery life and  not so much  the camera 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i feel like as a former android user  i switched just because i wanted to try the iphone nothing against my phone  one of the key features of iphones is longevity  even higher end android phones seem to start developing issues  slowing down  etc  iphones appear to be much more future proof  and you can rock a   yr old iphone and it will still work relatively well    the next feature is of course the ecosystem  once you and your friend start using iphones it is easy to see why it is hard to lock you in  iphones are a stealth social network  the way they integrate with the rest of the apple products is also second to none  i am going to assume  if i ever can justify buying something to replace my sony xms  is that the bluetooth pairing will work far more seamlessly with airpod w e that headset is called  it is a minor quibble  but a quibble nonetheless    finally  there is just the feel  iphones just feel more premium  i dont know how to explain it  but holding an iphone just feels more premium 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,is mkbhd losing touch with the average guy   why wouldn’t he have a price category   that’s a major limiting deciding factor in many phone choices 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,focus mode is already on xiaomi for over  years
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,id like to add one more category  budget smartphone  not everyone can afford a high end smartphone  plus if the iphone is lets the xr its still pretty costly like around k k which is weird given how that phone released  years ago  most people like budget phones to be connected and because of that android ecosystem  you talked about samsung ecosystem but the video is titled android  samsung things work with its devices but alot of things can work with a non samsung device which are an android basic device  rd you can choose a budget smartphone in android and you can tweek and search the specifications and features you need  i want clean android with a finger print  fast charging and in budget  i went with the motorola and there are many other companies which have this android and can provide it  th apple released the se series but the cost is still high  where as samsung motorola oppo vivo xiaomi real mi are giving good phones with a very budget friendly phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what kept here is the end of this video
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,please don’t misuse the term  psycho  as an insult  it’s a psychiatric word for people with psychosis spectrum disorders and or aspd and using it in that way further stigmatises us as a marginalised group that already experiences stigma  ableism  sanism and stereotyping  please find a different word next time that doesn’t harm neurodivergent mentally ill people
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have an idea guys  just buy a phone that meets your needs
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,they are all the states   microsoft  android  apple os is all us intel driven    why is that a thing to let us dominate all online devices  it doesnt make security sense if you are actually competiting with this country    you are giving them access to every person here 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if only the iphone is willing to give fast full charge in  minutes i will definitely move to iphone  if someone says fast charging will damage battery  then buy the new battery provides service for sustainable recycling battery
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, minutes of nothing new  everyones a winner  pick a side for once will you
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how you buy your iphone emi or one time payment
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its just me or the amount and wreid features of android seem to be false  and they are just there  to turn on off a switch but in the back doesnt do nothing 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,even my pixel  didnt get any  updates  dumb google 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, theres even some new stuff that the iphone has that android doesnt  a pretty good one is focus mode  android has focus mode for a while now 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,just buy bought even its old generation   to experience best of both worlds  and later in time you will realize you really need both  but as you get older youll come back to the iphones  haha
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for apps on pixel phones  android  you can upgrade the system apps to the latest one without upgrading the os  for example  if my phone os is android  i still can easily upgrade the call  message  calendar etc  to the latest one without upgrading to android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,prices 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i use android phone for hi res audio  and ipad for browsing  why choose side  have both
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as someone who buys a flagship iphone and holds on to it as long as physically possible  id factor in longevity of the product  and i dont just mean from a  how long will this turn on for  i also mean from a software updates and security improvements standpoint  i currently own an  pro max  and the specs and features of the  ultra are very appealing to me and im considering upgrading  i bought the  pro max the week of release  so almost exactly  years  and with tax  that is   a day  for the amount of use i put on my phone daily  since i dont have a tablet or laptop  thats very reasonable  i just wished it came is some exotic color besides the basic white  gray  black  and navy
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,loved this video  actually almost all of them but here i have two unrelated comments   great addition the spanish  track  on the videos  i dont use it  because im used to your voice and im fluent in english so it feels a bit odd  but great addition   i cant emphasise enough how nice is to see someone from us calling the country us and not america very minor thing  but actually relevant for the millions of other american  continent  people  like myself 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,seriously thinking about it
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would also mention the possibility of sideloading apps 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,t dial is missing from iphone  its a big feature
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,even tho i used android i still want apple coz may device go from green line to boot loop waste of time and money
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,people who move from apple to android  generally stick to android afterwards  people who move from android to apple usually move back to android  apples whole thing is to keep their customers within their ecosystem
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about security and privacy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,cameraman    when are we getting a dynamic notch on our android phone    we all know why it cant be named dynamic island 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,looking at apples ecosystem  the price and the  firewall  puts me off  android clearly the winner =d
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im the only one that thinks that price is also a major category  so many people buy stuff according to their price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,but why would you consider a developers point of view for apps  in the end its the common user as you stated for ease of use  there are just soo many end user reasons apps are better on android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,money can buy anything even people
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,interesting to hear the winning take in the apps category come down to ease of development  ignoring the option to side load apps  as well as user made apps   completely opting out of the category was  reparability  was an interesting choice too  but i can see it being removed for the sake of having an odd number of categories to get an objective winner  those things excluded though would agree with this assessment 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,graphics are very weak   content is rich
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is one of the most absolutely brilliant maskings of a  greenscreen  using a greenscreen to the left and a bluescreen to the right  so their reflected color actually looks natural with the composited background mostly matching those colors  would love to see a deeper dive into your process and setup recently ltt came out with a video on their  live compositing  greenscreen hardware for the gamelinked channel  but even the color correction there and the masking actually leaves a bit to be desired  dont get me wrong  they are better than   of even blockbuster masking  but thats the problem with greenscreens  even the best isnt good enough to look really real  this is the first time i think someones really taken it to the next level   of course  theres a few minor errors here and there in the edit it seems but the setup youve made is pristine 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is not good   it doesn’t have exclusivity factor  it’s design language is crude it’s ecosystem is basic at best and it’s growth over time is stale  this isn’t a diss to android users but we can agree that androids generally isn’t a desirable consumer product  i can understand with all the supposed tech geeks who appreciate things like customization and refresh rates but in all honesty most people don’t care about stuff like that at least in my case  every product we buy should represent how we see ourselves  android represents trying to me  apple represents comfort in their unique method which alot of us relate to
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what is keeping me from iphone  which just seems like a better ecosystem  is browser choice and charging cable  both of which are  maybe  going to become non issues  in the eu  soon   edit  android also keeps changing the alarm app  it is frustrating 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,green spill onto right side of mkbs head not good
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no one is talking about how xiaomi mi share send file at a rate of mb per second  way faster than apple airdrop
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the only reason i dont use an iphone is the ability to install third party applications on android almost like on a computer  you pay for the iphone and you need to pay for every single application  some apps are not even available in iphone like emulators  you have to be dumb enough to pay the money just for faster updates 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you havent talked about pricing  huh 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i completely agree with your opinion  but in a country like iran where you have no customer service for the iphone and the hype for it just comes from it being more expensive and snobbiness  i think it is kinda stupid to get one when you can have  android phones  with more features and better quality  with the same amount of money 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is for admins ios is for users   donald trump
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thank you  you made up my mind  iphone is my next phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think ive seen this video already   did you re upload or somethin
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’m sorry but i am not an android person in any way  shape or form and i prefer iphone apple products  i’m never going to switch back based on my horrible experiences i had with samsung   i’ve been a apple fan girl for a very long time   years  and i don’t plan on changing that anytime soon  those that like android that’s ok it’s your personal preference android is just not my cup of tea  when i used to use samsung i had nothing but problems after problems it was either the camera  overheating  battery charging port etc  or the connection to the cellular data sometimes it was everything in between when i switched to iphone i had   less problems than when i was with samsung so i decided to never turn back  but i guess in the end it gets down to everyone’s personal preference i will never knock what people like  i just know that in my own personal experience i did not have a great experience with samsung anytime i had any of their products  and in all honesty  if somebody asked me if i would recommend samsung  my answer would be a hard no  but i would give them my honest opinion but also tell them that they need to make the decision on their own   we are all not made out of cookie cutters  we all have our own personal preference of what we like but i can only make suggestions    i love your content and and your one of my favorite youtubers what i posted isn’t trying to spread negativity it’s just trying to let people know how i feel about a certain product  much love my friend  i have nothing but love and positivity to share  i just wanna share my experience 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i personally also take into account the philosophy behind the brand  having your costumers use their phones only the way you  the brand  want them to is kinda upsetting  not giving them options to easily repair their phones  having  regards with compatibility and connectivity with other devices  idk  it feels like youre   being treated like an idiot  and   getting a purposely limited device
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im using samsung ecosystem so i prefer android where my sister is using apples ecosystem so she prefer apple  its that simple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i wonder you can say same thing if you are an iphone user who lives outside of america 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’ve had both os’s and i will say  i prefer ios over android  the ios is reliable  useful  practical  and a digital swiss knife  i don’t really need all the customization etc 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,would have helped if there was an android power user in the making of this video
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,short answer for me is  if you have specific tastes and expectations from a phone you probably like android  if you want something that just works and is a  good phone  non specifically you probably like ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  you are missing the fact that you can not backup apps on an iphone anymore  while you can even sideload on an android  with apple you need to be ok with hoping apple or the developer does not pull their stuff from the app store  because if they do  your purchase is just gone  you can not install an older os on an iphone and though  years seems like a lot  many of the updates since iphone  will break compatibility with the ecosystem if you dont keep everything to the latest version  updating an older apple watch requires wiping and reinstalling  updating mac os has caused purchased apps to stop working multiple times  you might call the category  freedom  or  the device you bought with your cash is yours to use as you wish  you pay for ease of use and lack of features with apple by being forced to keep replacing hardware that still works as intended 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,calling siri forgotten for years   yikes  im sure theyre either working on something to compete with bard and chatgpt or that theyll just have bard built in to iphone similar to how iphone started with google map  lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i never cared of missed ecosystem till i move on ios they just made my life horrible my galaxy watch became useless bcz i love round watches also i use sony headphones and buds    but due to gaming habits i’m staying  also in last  year i have never activated imessage  and still don’t understand why its so popular i can do way more on what’s app   in india you go any store you will his whats app no printed on wall
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive been an android user since   switched to iphone last  i didnt like it  switched back to android  with my s ultra lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,man you nailed this comparison over again 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would love to switch to an iphone  from my pixel  but some features really hold me back  like an actual filesystem  so many apps on iphone leave their data behind even if you delete them  that is not acceptable  also the fact that iphones screens dim if the device gets a little hot  how is that acceptable with such a great cpu  and lets not even talk about the fragile glass back panel that is glued so strongly that you have to use a laser to repair it  no thanks 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,your score is quite perfect    of us are for that
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think of it more like a prison than an ecosystem 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,didnt sell enough overpriced shoes you have to make ridiculous clickbait like this 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you valid marques  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my sequence is this of most to least importance    apps  from many sources    customization   ease of use   excitement   features   updates   ecosystem  could not care less 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so not updating the apps qualifies as ease of use  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the only proplem is   apple is a church so its hard to fight again a religion 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i find  ease of use  to be greater with android     allow me to explain  i have used iphone for  years  and have still not figured out how to do so many things with it  but with android  i learned how to use all features of it overnight  the learning curve of android is much shorter 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,freedom mean android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,quality over quantity my friends love that expression marques 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i wish all of you guys all the best 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as decade long android user who has dabbled in iphone and currently supplied a  for work  i prefer iphone hardware but android os  pixel in particular  and for me the os always won  but i swore last year if pixel used another under screen fp sensor on the   im done   years if frustration with it  especially now that the  will have usb c  im making a solid effort to switch to iphone this year 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,file manager  running retro emulators  and samsung dex is the reason i switched to samsung and i dont regret it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about multitasking  im team samsung all day and ive owned iphone  and   iphones are tech for non tech people 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what you are fogetting with the os updates from apple is that it usually comes with obsolescence  let me explain what i mean  i have had several apple products  and with every ios update  the product became slower  to the point of unusability  i learned to turn the auto updates off on any apple products  i have not had an android phone so i cannot comment on them  i did just purchase one though  so if anyone has any insights as to whether android phones have the same obsolescence built in i would appreciate it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i mean very few of these so called  reviewers  are fair  everyone is biased because at the end of the day  they need invites from the big corpos like apple  samsung  etc  so if they once get into their bad books  they will struggle to even pay the bills  new age of marketing
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the majority of people dont even need a smartphone  lets have that discussion 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my life depends on apple to design but i have no intention of ever buying an iphone  they cost too much and i  never apple was a phone company  what i need is a reliable phone for calls and texts and checking my email  for the things an iphone does  better  i have an ipad  if i need to use imessage or facetime i can plus access apps made for apple  i have a motorola phone because theyre reliable  dont come with app bloat and affordable 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,we all know who the winner is  cough  the platform he mains  cough  but mb knows his audience so hes gotta throw them a bone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is the most balanced and objective review ive seen regarding android vs apple  the outcome is not the cliché  you decide  which it is  but it explains in a clear manner how you can factually decide which is the best phone for you really 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,your incredible best influencer and product reviewer period 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,that second one is me  ecosystem is number one  then apps  and features but we know apple will always lag behind on that so that’s where apps come in 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,his hearts wants apple and his mind wants androd 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,other factor does help  but excitement category will not help on day to day use 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,does anyone know the name of the intro and outro song 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have to disagree with support and apps  yes there are lots of apple store but the support they provide is terrible   out  times they will push you to just throw away your device for a new one or charge an insane price for the support repair  google specifically for me has the best support ive ever seen  for technical support you can literally just go to your settings and get connected in min to someone at google that will guide you to fix your problem  and for the only time ive ever had to get a phone fixed it took  emails total all on the same day and they shipped me a new phone  and for apps  theres the fact that the same apps are generally way cheaper on android and also that you can install apps from outside of the play store which is major 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,both are good but the most important thing for me and for a lot of ppl is the price  and here no doubt android win 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i actually stick to android for a couple of apps not offered on ios  the main one being poweramp  i dont do music streaming so poweramp and neutron are way better than anything ios can offer  unfortunately that also coincided with samsung flagships having expandable storage and really important for an audiophile  a headphone jack  this is why i been hanging on to my s+  not sure whats next that checks those boxes for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use doesnt matter if youre a g   updates support dont matter if you upgrade every year  or two  so the undisputed winner is and continues to be android   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,they are both bad tbh  i wish we had a third option
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,updates and support apple  really   the reason why old iphones get new updates is so apple can throttle the shit out of them forcing the user to upgrade  ya that sounds like a winner for sure  also can iphones install rd party apps  nope but android can
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,didnt watched  android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,updates just changed  and fairphone offers like  years now  so much more than apple  and since you can easily swap the battery and repair everything  its actually realistic to be able to use it in  years if speed and gaming doesnt matter that much 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,do not buy samsung phone pathetic battery optimization go for apple i have  mah battery m and i use less then  hour in a day still it run only for a day in  to   and my hardware and battery is good i have also old jmax that one batter pefrom th
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this was so useful as someone who hasn’t upgraded in a few years and looking to upgrade for both myself and family…the flip phones look so cool but we’re so deep in the ecosystem that it really makes it hard to switch  this video made me realize that i just care too much abt the ecosystem and am not willing to spent a bunch of time customizing so what’s the point of switching now 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,people still use android phones 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,camera comparison and multi tasking are two important categories that android aleo wins
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this video is about all of android  but samsungs ecosystem doesn’t work as well for other androids  also  even if a company has any many pieces of an ecosystem the quality of how they all work together matters immensely  and also for certain features the number of other people that can access it does too it’s also more likely an older iphone will be capable of running a new apple ecosystem feature  or any update to a feature  then an android would
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,premium paper weight   you spend so much money on materials instead of getting good specs
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me apple wins  i have no time to sit doing customisation  i am ok with out of the box settings with a few minor changes…   and m good    being apple to multitask like a pro is a big win win for ios   ios >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,using both oses ill always go towards the android one  i have a pixel  galaxy and iphone and the samsung is by far the best and like a mix between the two  plus like you said  samsung has literally everything you could want to connect to  they make pretty much whatever electronic you need in your home including heat and air conditioners  apple just has laptops  tablets and desktops  the video should have been samsung vs apple  because android is not as customizable as one ui is on top of it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ok what if i care a lot about ecosystem apple would have a lot of points  i do care a lot about my google ecosystem  these are base on popularity not actual facts 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when you dont want to use your brain constantly  use iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,imessage and facetime is obsolete in most of the world  whatsapp exists 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios is not easy to use  whenever i try to sort out simple stuff on my mums phone its the most counter intuitive system ive ever used 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, iphone is the clear winner  in camera sadly no matter how many megapixel android is loaded with 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the calculator is actually the worst thing about iphone  i just hate it  ive tried so many third party but theres no good free version of calculator  i prefer mobi calculator on android  main thing is it keeps history  even after a week if i think of the numbers i crunched  i can go back and check the no i got 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have  very  old  android phones but still useable this   also using a windows laptop and whenever i need to transfer any files from my phone to my laptop its very easy  heck i can even edit documents on my phone then send to my laptop if i need to work using a bigger screen v v   plus the rd party apps are way better for android   if you know what i mean    i do have a macbook pro and for me its an overpriced and oversized paper weight  cant run anything properly from the last  years especially on games  hard to transfer files convert to a more  common  application  yes that ecosystem is a big factor and if you look at the bigger picture  ios products runs seamless on things made by apple  android apps  end products run easier on everything else even on ios    for me im never going back to using any ios product  well except for my ipad which i use to play plants vs zombies  occassionally 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,forgot about security
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if the black berry storm had apps that topped apple back in the day then blackberry would have won  i own a iphone and thats the only apple product i own  its really nothing new  i had a apple s and went to a  mini  i will wait just as long to upgrade because there is no real difference besides performance of phones in apple with the same product being released  i own a samsung galaxy s tablet and i prefer it over a notepad anyday  it great to have a change in products every now and then  but apple somehow found the perfect key of not changing anything at all but still being able to sell the same product every year  they are set 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone still sucks   the fact they try make the pc experience garbage   transferring your files to a pc such an inconvenience   to push you to buy a mac   just unethical at that point
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is great  but mabey a video for each topic
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,every year my phone rotation is the same  fold  pixel  iphone repeat 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i went from an s to an iphone  pro  and now will go back to android  iphones used to be amazing  now the os is half baked  the apps are poorly optimized  and they crash way more than i expected them to  and i always need to google how to do x thing  which i could do in android  just to find out that it cant be done  the face id though is very good  it is fast and reliable  which i really like  yeah  and it is really really boring  android is way more fun  especially if you follow the best apps for android for month  series on youtube  you can find and play around with some really cool apps 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thank you for putting this together  its quite measured and well thought out  i will have to disagree with you about the ecosystem  are there only  apps in apples ecosystem  what about googles ecosystem of software   gmail  google photos  gogole drive  even its notes app which you can share checklists etc with people  googles messenger app uses the latest standard  rcs  and the major usability plus is that you cant tell who is messaging from iphones vs other devices because they seamlessly bridge the gap that apple has made by trying to wall off their functionality  its just been my experience  i hate that i have to buy an entire device to be part of the apple ios ecosystem when google makes it seamless for users instead of making walls 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love android  the love affair started when i was an apple fan but got the galaxy note  out of curiosity  the pen and sd card got me so when i went back to iphone  i felt incomplete and when i would return to the note  i felt complete again  the back and forth ended after i sold my iphone x and never bought an iphone again  currently on my galaxy note + from   for me  the pen  the customization  features  file management inside of android and multitasking with two apps at same time kept me happy on android  i could never be happy with an iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,omg…that app part really hits me hard because  i currently working in qa field  which i know nothing of  and ios coders are just different from android programers in my experience  android developers working so hard to make the function works on every devices  meanwhile ios developers seems really lazy with coding  yet apps are still just works 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i get it  people like apple for how much their phones dont have a real setup but my favorite part of android is the lengthy setup  its in depth and is very great  i use android for this reason  i want one thing from android though  and thats being able to transfer my launchers shades photos videos from my old phone to my new phone using a usb drive 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, a tough debate that will last the ages  perhaps the vision pro will tip the scales 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro os so careful to not start a war he cant stop … its fine boss just go straight to point and pick 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hah  bro is using android  on the pixel  pro while talking about android   big oof 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im just said that you dont know we can imessage on android now
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,findmy alone is the killer feature that cannot be achieved with an android phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dont forget to mention that iphones still cant use their nfc touch point to connect to a wifi network
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,your take on the ecosystem score seems beyond insane given that android is the most common os on earth  its in ten of thousands of products produced by over a thousand brands 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,speaking of missing features the iphone originally launched without mms  like the best camera on a phone at that time and you couldnt freaking text it to someone lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,love android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,um android has focus mode
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,make repairability a category  cant  believe how ignored this is 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would love to see a precise and in depth comparison between the ecosystems  not just samsung vs apple  but also how well do different andorid devices mesh together to form an ecosystem that transcends brands  and how does and overall android ecosystem compare to the apple ecosystem 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the video we needed but not the one we deserved  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its personal preference at this point  just stop complaining about the color of the bubbles haha
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ey  are you not going to talk about huawei  been looking forward to it everyday
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, only    new phones released each year  are you out of your mind  that is way too much and way too frequent for anything substantial to change between drops 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,acutally  the king in security updates is fairphone with  years  yes   years of security updates for your smartphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as someone whos tired ios and had to use mac for a while now  for me a  year old who grew up on windows  ios has had moments where i wanted to just break it  ease of use for me easily goes to android  especially if you customise the phone to work exactly how you want it making it  easier  that ios by default
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,we need that scoring system in excel spreadsheet  i am still trying to decide between a galaxy s  a z fold s   an iphone  pro max and a pixel fold
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android for me  having a system wide ad blocker is amazing  able to share any content using any wired or wireless connection like bluethoot or wifi with any other device  file system management to organize my documents  books  homework and more  access ftp in local network  nas file system and network devices 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,probably my favorite mkbhd video ever  good objective look at both platforms  i use android personally  have an iphone for work  i like both platforms for different reasons but prefer android by a gnats eyelash for my personal daily driver 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,that mac pro flower pot tho
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dirty lies  just keeping the peace
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,personally i would never choose the iphone due to their high price  a redmi note  pro for  euros is more than enough for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,didnt include price because price doesnt matter to the rich i guess
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,anyone have those wallpapers he had on the iphone in the beginning 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,outro was clean ngl
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,name of phone stand at  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i always find it funny when we have the same debate among friends and they vote for iphone because of long term support   years  but they keep buying the new models every   years 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why do you bother pretending mb  every time you make another one of these truly sincere and honest  comparison  videos  apple always win  obviously they are paying you to do them  just be honest ffs 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,he should have added in customer support in the us  thats what tips me over personally for when a product starts acting wrong 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,does anyone else think that the editing on this one was lacking a bit  compared to other video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,whoever sees this  save yourself the headache and do not look at buying a samsung microwave  washer  or dryer  saying they suck is an understatement but ill keep it pg 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,every android phone manufacturer has its own interface  so you cannot compare these two  every iphone has the same interface  and every next generation of iphone is almost the same as the previous one  i think that they are not putting much in but asking for much more money every time  so as for the camera  design  and innovation in every aspect curved display foldind phones punchole camera under screen camera fingerprint sensor face unlock screen to body ratio    android phones were first and much better 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,just for the fact iphone got imessage  that by itself just destroys android  anyway isnt android for poor people  thats what i have always been told
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,team android    
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you say  copying  most of it is just logical stuff   and as for no bloatware ever  never forget u 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,was a former iphone user  when i decided to try android  first was like meh  then id say ima give it a good  months   then at the  month ima luke this is me  staying with android   tho i only  missed the imassage on the iphone but after over  years of being android i dont see my self going back to iphone  the fact i can put my only apps in my hone screen and arranged them how i want them makes me stay with android   sorry iphone  bye bye
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i am on the hunt for a new phone and this video explains exactly what i am struggling with 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,clearly  clearly android is big win  if you talk about eco system then samsung is winner in android  i have seen so many blind fans  fanboys  who just stick with iphone thinking it is status phone  they dont even know how to change some settings in phone and says i love apple phone only  about app categories marq said  i dont agree with him at this point  because apple gives  or  devices in single year  they need to worry about less devices and their support  meanwhile android has huge dataset of devices to follow up  clearly it need time to support all  thats not minus point in my point of view 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,sideloading should weigh in here  i went to the us for vacations and was locked out of checking prices in a store because that requires the app  that is blocked in my phone because of my carrier
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love android a lot i mean a lot but just for security purpose i had to buy an iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,regarding the apps section  as an android user  i can tell you that even the uploaded photo quality on the ig fb stories is low compared to the iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,both are the best 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,usb c   fps vídeo recorder in front camera and ready for black skin  face id  dtv  brazil has the best dtv technology of the world  the phone should use it  and big scream  this is my dream smartphone and moto e get close that i can buy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,former android user here  ios sucks for me  it feels like i dont really own the device  its like if apple borrowed it to me  thats how bad the customization is  and i pretty much agree with marques except for the apps  there is of course the quality factor but soo many of the ios apps are behind a paywall  that i was literally forced to stop using a couple of services  that were offered on android by different developers for free thanks to bigger competition 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why even bother putting  the real winner  in the title 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,anyone know what magnetic phone stand mkbhd uses   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android also have advantage in pricing
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,good vid lol funny though how your main is a pixel  obviously because you’ve said before that you prefer using android  alongside an iphone and those are the next  big phones coming out 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wait i thought iphone was sued because someone proved that updates on their older phones literally kill em
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about the price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nicely done 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it is really not american to mention  in the u s  appreciated marques  in all europe nobody uses imessage or facetime  but whatsapp  i kind disagree only on the updates point  i was initially disagreed also to apps  but you make your point  just because apple doesnt really make the new system work on the older devices  which when they get the often become battery drainers and bricked 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android phones are most easiest phone to use even for the people who is not tech friendly and who cant  read and write
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wow it is so easy to use iphone without home and back button  very intuitive controls indeed  also i just love that i cant control the signal volume without searching for it in the settings   my favourite user friendly feature   p s  almost forgot   big props to apple for not letting me close all apps with one touch  now in can use my spare time to swipe each separate app away to close it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i switched to android and every time i use an iphone i feel like im using a toy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its like messi  iphone  vs ronaldo  android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nice content  you probably should do a comparison between apple maps and google maps also
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,could you add security in your next evaluation  it would help filter out the hype of infected software apps  that we read about in the tech press  great video  marques 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,updates and long term support did it for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i went to see if apple will win or android  and i came back knowing i’m the one who is winning… i need more mkbhds in my life lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,intro music name 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,we are in  and still no splitscreen option on the iphone  this is ridiculous   android having splitscreen for more then a decade   come one apple where is the real productivity option in the iphone max ultra we want really multitasking on the screen 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would argue the case of use going to apple  i am an android user and find iphones hard to navigate always an extra step
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,whatever bro  iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video but a major factor which you do not mention is price  i phone pricing is ridiculous and way out of the ordinary persons wallet  thanks for your video ken
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wallpaper 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you should mention battery 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,really nice video  could we get an actual smartphone comparison for the most efficient budget smartphone  and by efficient i mean great chipset  camera   screen etc
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,fairphone  =>  warranty +   years of software updates
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,these  comparasions  are so distorted by apples relentless promotion machine  it is almost comical  it all started when apple had a single phone to offer for years and years in a row and everybody thought that was fine  then  everybody bought the marketing of meh quality displays when compared to amoled  just because apple came up with cute name of  retina  this also was ok for years and interactions in a row  now  samsung has foldable phones   foldable    and everyone still thinks apple has an edge in anything  when it comes to smartphones and tablets  one of these days  the koolaid will be served and there will be a strong relief in the worlds overpopulation problem  i guess 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you need to add security  otherwise a great conversation 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thank you for finally breaking this down and explaining how its really about whats most important to you and what features you want 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, never any bloatware  ever on an iphone  i would argue that its full of it  and its all apple bloatware  we just seem to dismiss it because its not rd party bloatware 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the  ecosystem  argument is just stupid   i want to use a phone period no need to buy with it the whole apple overpriced products  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if i only count the features that matters for me  i am counting   to android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think iphones are for usa  where else on earth is facetime popular  lol  people just use whatsapp
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in addition to this  i have a more principled objection to apple  ive been a computer tech for over  years and apple stuff is always way too expensive and a massive pain to fix  using any ios software  mobile or desktop  feels like walking through sandpaper  its never smooth and never  not once   just works  apple hasnt innovated anything since   the lightning cable  and just rebrands things they ripped off from android or others  combine that with the elitist bully culture apple has willingly and gleefully curated and i will refuse to ever use apple products just based on principle 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i find the google pixel very easy to use  everything is just laid out for convenience  the example of the iphone layout being the same  will be easy if youre a previous iphone user  but if youre not  it may not be easier 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i agree with everything except apps  your  average users  wont notice the difference between ios or android version of apps  but allowing myself to grab an apk of basically any thing i want or need takes the cake anyday
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no bloatware on the iphone  i remember when they installed apps and wouldnt let you uninstall them  thats bloatware in my mind 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hello mkbhd  there are so many other criteria for comparison which you forgot to include  some which are more practical in consideration for this generation of consumers  such as security of device  affordability  bug fixes and customer service  i have come across people who absolutely love apple and their devices for all the positives you highlighted in the video above  but end up using a mid tier android device since they cant afford an iphone  price is a real life determining factor for which side an average consumer would lean to  majority of consumers do not understand the price to use a premium product  and they would be willing to settle for less  not to mention middle class families  who would not even think of spending that amount of money on apple devices  as they earn their daily bread just to get through the month  any thoughts  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about security 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one thing that is currently extremely annoying about iphone is the amount of different chargers required when travelling  if you have an iphone  ipad  mini  air  or pro  or greater in any of them  then you need a usb c charge cable  the iphone itself can use a magsafe charger or a lightning cable  airpods can use a lightning cable  the apple watch needs its own separate charger  you could end up needing  separate cables depending on what youve got  on android  its one usb c cable and youre set since you can reverse wireless charge your watch from your phone  and if not its one more cable 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the only reason for me to buy an iphone right now is airdrop  i mean  nothing in android comes close  heck not a single alternative even gets remotely close to how seamless airdrop is between apple devices  i much prefer an android phone personally  but the amount of times a day i have to transfer pictures from my phone to my macbook makes it such a slow and annoying chore  im using corporate onedrive  that i just want to have access to airdrop  personally as i said before  if i had to buy a brand new phone today to replace my old trusty and reliable s+  i would prefer to get either the s ultra  or any other comparable flagship android phone but with a microsd slot  its either i get dex  or i get expandable storage lol   but right now  it is really tempting for me to wait until the iphone  comes out with that beautiful seamless notchless display ive always wanted  i actually was planning on getting the mi mix before i got my s+  but locally it was only imported in its base model   which was gb ram and gb non expandable storage  during my time with my s+ ive learned that gb just isnt enough for me  neither is gb  i had gb sd card  now im using a gb sandisk extreme pro sd card + gb internal storage   so realistically that means if i am going to get an iphone itd have to be gb at least or even tb  or if it is a samsung flagship it would have to be gb at least if not even tb  the reason why im considering tb is because i know i am going to be using my next phone for a couple of years and i know that i am almost certainly going to fill it with more than gb during that time  if samsung didnt go the apple route and kept microsd card support in their phones than the choice wouldve been so much simpler  but since its basically  apples to apples  here there really is no significance of one over the other   except for airdrop vs dex   and i would pick airdrop over dex in a hindsight right now lol 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,he forgot about the price factor
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,make that ecosystem video please 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the biggest issue i have with my iphone  is the lack of any led indicator that i have unread notification without turning the screan on and the fact that the recent call history is insanely limited 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,on social media as a big fan android we just lose there
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the winner is the friends we made along the way
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,is it true  if google phone shoot at fast speed  cameras software starts to freeze 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i pretty love your channel and reviews  its exciting to hear someone who is not a blindness apple fan boy
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, years of security updates  you clearly live in the past  samsung offers  years of os updates and  years of security updates nowadays  also  it must be mentioned that even though the iphone r will get the latest ios version this year it wont get so many of the features announced because its too old so it doesnt really matter
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,something interesting that you mention is the cultural aspect of what’s important  in the us imessage and facetime are super big while in the eu whatsapp is super huge so having an iphone just for imessage is not as much of a selling point 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its interesting  when i watched it  by the end  i said  oh yeah  apple makes a better phone  ive always known that  but it isnt the better phone for me  i dont care about apps  ease of use  ecosystem  or updates  i barely actually use my phone so i want customization and flexibility  plus  i can get a used oneplus flagship for like  bucks  and even used apple devices can run twice that  i think you did miss a couple categories though  namely  durability  security  and reliability  its obvious why those werent picked  android runs the full gamut on that  but those are more important to many than  ecosystem  and so on 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,feature wise answer chat messages  manage mail  and most importantly distinct between different types of notifications from the single app  for example  hide ads from app  but keep real notifications from that same app   support wise  pretty much any major version update for older phones makes them worse  slower and glitchy  thats been a situation for all ios devices from the start  and apple shamelessly keeps slowing older devices  its better not to update the major version of ios on iphone at all   ecosystem or accessories wise  ios just doesnt cut it  there aint no any bluetooth codecs for quality sound  aptx nor ldac  and watches  oh boy  apple watch are simply no match for the galaxy watches  apple watch are getting clumsy health and sleep readings notifications are useless and non functional   its just text on screen without any functions  in the whole ios  and the customization of watch screen just doesnt allow making an easy to see and use watch   dedicated thing  there are no way to have ad blocker in your browser in ios  they even dont allow plugins in firefox on ios  ios users are forced to use internet with all the ads nightmare  this is a massive no no   frankly  if not for imessage support  id be dropping iphone from my life as a nightmare it is 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,we all know  ease of use  was added as a category only to give iphone  point  this category literally does not exist in real life 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the features i want in an iphone are simple   first of all a delete button to delete the mistyped number in the calculator application so that i dont want to re input all the prices of grocery all over again  and  clipboard feature in which i could copy many things at once and paste as i wish 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well said  the winner is absolutely us  personally i’m glad that there are so many people that prefer android devices which in my eyes are just not that good  that way apple keeps developing and isn’t charging like k for an iphone   also there’s just way too much choice in the android world and i just want to get a good product which works flawless and can be used for years to come  so i found the apple world to be perfect for me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you dident know that so is is it so that appel thinks a littel smarter becus they add some few futers evry yers so that appel fnas alwey get nwe futers insted of how android thos fastes is com a new thing is it addet on android so after a time they run othe on futers just thin abutit like samsung s  and s  or z fold  and  ore flip  and  is sume exampels  it may be a litel bit boring but also exaitning you alxeys know next iphon will have new futers but android is geting more and more boring white less new thinks and more and more the same for evry yer that gos
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why would most people even want more than  years of updated  devices are severely obsolete by then  and the vast majority will have replaced it after  years  make them more recyclable instead 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about the repair ability category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hey marques  in the feature section you mentioned that iphones have focus mode while android phones doesn’t  i would like to correct that i use an mi phone and it have an focus mode prebuilt without any third party application activation  it might not be as advanced as iphones but this feature is there i dont know about other android phone though i am pretty sure some brands have it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i started with android  then moved to iphone  then came back to android  then came back again to iphone  i would say that ios and iphone bring me more comfort and reliability overall  but propose less technical innovations  and more slowly  i just think with time i tend to prioritize practicability over innovation  thats why i feel better with iphone now
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its simple if u want everything just get both a android and a apple mobile phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,strongly disagree on the ease of use  unfortunately you got this point wrong  no one forces you to go into customizing things on android  its great out of the box  and  people choose  iphones simply because they dont want to learn the new system — its not a conscious decision  its familiarity thing and maybe  prestige   marketing   brand power  apple is simply a way stronger brand  it doesnt make ios better   disagree on apps too  iphone apps are more expensive   they are more restrictive   you cant sideload apps   there is fewer free apps too   and quality wise it may be true that android offers much more garbage apps  but thats the obvious consequence of an open system  id rather have to go through garbage than have apple control and face all the limitations of the appstore
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hey the oneplus  has focus mode 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i always enjoy and draw so much from your videos  i have been a samsung user   phone  tablet  laptop  smart tv  air buds  speakers   for over a decade  i am very happy with samsungs ecosystem 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont get marques selection of categories  and unfortunately  he didnt share why he sets up this comparison the way he did   i would add at least two other categories  available device designs   clear winner  android [e g  flip foldable phones] and security   clear winner  iphone [e g  face id]  doesnt make the decision easier  but for sure more complete  plus  interoperability is irrelevant if you dont own other apple devices  whilst flexibilty customization is irrelevant if you use your smartphone stock  like many  if not most people do  even now  no edge for one or the other  but then  well  why not refine this procedure and give it a come back every year or two 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wheres money   or affordability   i think that is pretty big factor from customers perspective
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android users  but you pay for the apps on iphone…right  ive never paid once
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im android and my family is iphone and its annoying  i want to facetime and imessage them but im just not willing to give up the features and comfort i have with my android setup for those two things  if anyone has a great solution to this please let me know 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nice summary d
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use is bad in my country for apple cuz we have no store and u know what apple does so u cant fix thier phones unlike android so with out continuing i see android as the best
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple  give me icon packs 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  things do become easier to use when they can be customized to suit your needs  so  i think thats only about ease of use — if your needs happen to line up with what apple believes you need 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,price is also a driving factor   ive found you can often pay at least a third more for apple products relative to their android rivals  when you factor this in  in terms of pure value for money it is hard to beat android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i had my pitchfork at the ready ive put it dwn  ecosystem is important  i run house and lfe through android and samsung  the hassle to change isnt worth it  but thats what theyre hoping from apple and android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think of this in a different way  see both apple and google are trying their best to give the end user a seamless mobile computing experience  i mean as a tech enthusiast and a power user  for both of them are equally important  i have my iphone  pro max as my daily driver does its job seamlessly  while my s ultra is my dedicated device for moving data around  using s pen to take down notes  very intuitive and robust android on oneui  so i know i am from a veryfew who love both equally and own both of them  but if i have to pick only one  it will be very difficult because as you mentioned in the video it really depends on ones personal preference really  for some the iphone migbt appeal as an ideal device  and for some android be the right choice so i think this debate no longer matters and both os have matured to a level that they both are doing great in their market share 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,now when people ask me why i dont want a iphone i can send this video i like more options and choices with flexible thats android to me always will be
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the software update should belong to android simply because apple has stayed in trouble for the updates that they have that decrease the battery causes the phone to have issues  i would give the update and support to android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone for adults who need to reliably get shit done  android for kids or unemployed adults to tinker with 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the real winner is the user that gets to exercise their preference
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,good one  i watch ur video regularly 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as a tech reviewer you get a new phone every couple of weeks  so its natural that you miss a pretty big point for a lot of people  longevity   iphone is famous for being able to work perfect for  years+ while having significantly less ram  battery  cpu perf   for an android to work smoothly you gotta have gb ram  latest cpu etc  that adds up to  +  and still after   years its only way of use is throwing it in a trash bin because its laggy  buggy and outdated  while i can sell my + yo iphone  for  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,mkbhd  of course  he will give point to apple all the time 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,could  only  use  an apple  i phone  which is  now the  nokia
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thank you for this video  and the end especially   too many people fail to see that there are a lot of criteria  and the weight you give to those criteria depends on your personal needs  preferences  and use cases   the main reason i switched to ios is the stability  and the reliability that comes with that stability  so im disappointed its not on your list of criteria  many still cite the  it just works  mantra as their reason for using an iphone  the gap in stability has closed tremendously in the past decade  but if you highly value this criterion  youll have to go to the iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,facetime and imessage in the us  but in the rest of the world  we have android phones and we use whatsapp  signal  telegram  keep that in mind please 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,getting the apps win for the apple is just laughable  there is so much more stuff for the android  starting from different apps for reddit instagram youtube and ending with very niche products  and the ecosystem  have you ever tried move separate files from iphone to macbook  lets hope that the airdrop works  otherwise god knows how you gonna do it without breaking files on both your phone and macbook 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wow  very well said  sir  thank you 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,l video
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,pretty pathetic to do such a comparison with no mention of the critical factor for millions  privacy  as you well know android was created from the ground up to exploit and profit from its customers  apple protects user privacy to the extreme  major fail  amateur stuff 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android rocks iphone no innovation
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dont forget about storage on android is leagues ahead  almost every apple user i know has to pay for icloud storage for their photos and has to delete apps regularly to download new updates
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,market share of mobile operating systems worldwide   published by statista research department  aug     android maintained its position as the leading mobile operating system worldwide in the second quarter of  with a market share of   percent  androids closest rival  apples ios  had a market share of   percent during the same period   the best one is the most accessible to everyone  in this case it is android since you get similar functionality and in some cases more for a lot less money  most of ios users are in the us and with good reason and its because they have more buying power than the rest of the world 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have to say  the results were not a surprise  but   still a good job
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,until the ease of use part  included  seems like a good video  however then updates support starts and dont get me wrong  im not mad at where the point goes to  im mad on how its portrayed  first of all  the whole support thing was already an argument in ease of use  to bring that up almost seems like creating two same categories where the iphone gets two points basically for winning one  then  yes  sure  apples stores give apple the edge on control over support  however  and that should be told at least  that also comes at a price  getting an iphone repaired is very expensive and very limited to apple stores  while repairing an android can often even be done at home  the story goes on with the amount of updates the systems recieve  yes  the average ios gets more updates than the average android  however you do get the choice what u go for when buying an android  fairphone  who actually competes with apple in amount of major updates wasnt even mentioned  neither was the option of custom roms on android  giving so many devices so many major android updates  yes  its not for the average user  partly because they just dont know about it because it never gets mentioned  like here  again  all of that does not mean android has to get these points  but it should get mentioned and taken into consideration when picking a winner  if only to show the win is much tighter than shown here   where i disagree with the winner too is apps  i dont know how much u know about software development and who the people u talk to are  but what u brought up here is not just missing information like before  but made extremely one sided  starting with quantity of apps  third party app stores and the option to install apks is not even mentioned  even tough it gives u an even bigger quantity advantage and a big advantage for developers to test their apps  not just on different devices but also different kinds of users  and the advantages go on with development  to develop an ios app you need a mac  that is a huge inconvinience  specially when u develop for more than just ios  which is probably as common today as developing individual apps   havent watched further yet because therr was just too much wrong in the last two segments
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,can you please review the fairphone  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,been a pixel user for  years  changed for iphoen because of the video camera and instagram optimisation  there was no a single moment i regret it  even when sanction been applied to russia and now apple pay doesnt work  and theres no option to have side app to make contactless payments  like on an android you can have a side app other than google pay  and still the iphone is better
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,google phones are good for  reason software is good

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,huawei mate pro review when 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,beeper could change things in the us when it comes to imessage relevance  but yeah in other countries most people use whatsapp or other messaging platforms and not imessage    love this video  nice job  i struggle with deciding between both so i switch often haha  might just have to carry both around like you do  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what are the products in the background  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my wife had a samsung phone for a while  i  android fan that i am  migrated her to an iphone xr because it had at the time by far the best battery life for a well supported okay ish sized phone  she still thinks its impossible to use  its not just one feature she finds horribly unusable  but by  far  the worst feature on the iphone is the lack of  print to pdf   every single time  she has to ask me to do it  and i forget every  months and google it  im a comp sci major and even i cant figure out that damn phone   feature 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you think world means america and europe 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,have to absolutely disagree with updates and support of ios  yeah  youve got new ios on a lot of devices  did you get something from it except of new number in software info  of course no  all new features  even software  only for latest iphone  so  to tell the truth  every iphone have only  year real support  until next one is coming 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,huawei mate  pro
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there is never a definitive answer  why do people still make watch these videos  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,geez   days and this video is already obsolete  please  do the huawei mate  pro  thanks   mate 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i just hate how continuously shady you are against apple in every  single  video u make jokes about apple and are always ready to lick their bum at the right moment in the right videos so they still keep u in the list of favourites  its just so obvious that u dont like them u only do this for your business  even the positive comments never feel genuine and its just bad to watch when you do it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about durability and world wide support 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,multitasking  iphone stops uploading or downloading as soon as you lock it  like really wtf cant upload an instagram story if you leave the app or download a gopro video if you leave the app  super powerful chip but it does not like to do things in the background  just because of that i cant live with an iphone ive got a lot of stuff to do to wait for every process to be finished  on the other hand with my samsung i can text in whatsapp while i download my gopro videos  i can upload a story while the phone is locked in my pocket  i can connect  bluetooth headphones  any brand  and share my music  which i use a lot while driving my motorcycle  its crazy that the iphone being so smooth and a great phone in many ways still cant do all this stuff 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the only reasons people buy iphones are shallow  social media image quality  facetime  and just to say they dont have an android  apple arent really offering much more 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ehm  price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the funny thing is how much both apple and android have stuck to their brands for so long  if you asked me  years ago the core difference between android and iphone  i would have said  android is way more customizable and ‘do anything’ power user friendly  but iphone is way more easy to use and ecosystem friendly if you are a mac user  both phones have benefited from being pushed by each other  but they are still kind of in the same lanes as they’ve always been  which i weirdly appreciate 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have an iphone for calls text social media  and an android phone for work files  pc transfer receive  etc  no competition for me lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,u need to add after sale service
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no winner lol al up to what people want dat simple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,he didnt even talk about the option for apks  thats a huge + android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hey marques  i would also take innovation as a category  and then rate this towards android  foldables 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,please give me a one smart phone i started gameplay in youtube for my feture 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,funny watching this it’s apple for me still  i got a samsung s ultra and wasted my money because i don’t use it much  great camera on it but for apps and speed i feel apple is just much better  my s ultra is just a paperweight now  shame but it still like new and only ever had been charged twice so far 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,less glitchy  iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,build quality  iphone

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,focuses mode is already on android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,reliability and longevity  iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,updates and support goes to ios with all the non repairability of ios devices  what about the cost factor  ios devices are notorious when it comes to value for money  their support  their tech cost is so overrated and so close sourced and limiting  android devices can last decades with custom roms 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,spotting the easter egg in the background the green computer setup with the blue background for the mac  blue bubbles vs green bubbles 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple iphone against the android world 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,include environment friendly as well 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,valuable video  thanks marques
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,are we ever going to get one phone with all the bells and whistle’s from one of these companies   who’s eventually is going to culminate all of these features and assets into one solitary phone for the consumer to enjoy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,yes r may get the ios  update but is it really efficient  it will run out of battery in an hour lol  it is one of apples many tricks  where they give a taste of new features and ui to the old users and make them to upgrade to the newer series by silently degrading their current phones performance 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lil doug demuro reference with the cool factor at the end
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you missed the most important money
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the winner is android as long as you don’t care about your personal data and security 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,we all know you either go android or you go gay  simple as that
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,amazingly done  you might end a looming civil war with this  having said that  i feel a pretty important category got overlooked  hardware   specifically the durability of it  up until  i had only used androids   and used to break at least one a year  in  though  i switched over to iphone and haven’t even needed a repair   despite no reduction in the number of accidents my slippery fingers have with phones    and despite everything else  this is the one reason i definitely continue sticking to iphones 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what phone had the hz 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use i will always choose android  samsung  since of the goodlock features
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the ecosystem is akin to a  chakravyuh  – easy to enter but challenging to exit  its advisable to utilize services from various vendors  ensuring that you dont become overly reliant on a single service  providing the flexibility to discontinue its use if necessary 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thnx mb  one thing do  with apps  is it not a huge advantage that with apple you get  almost  a   secure   save to use   checked by apple app 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love the iphone because of ease of use  i always buy my parents iphones because teaching them how to use android would be a hell in of itself 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the easiest to use is android  i phone can never come closer to that point for me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,is there a way to port android os into iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,that ending though  i like  life is to be enjoyed 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it’s weird how ios does not have a clipboard in 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,please do the new huawei trash phone lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the winner is… the phone you enjoy and find useful for your needs 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,droid  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro whyre your outros so emotional that almost made me cry w that bg music 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple ecosystem   apple refrigerator  apple micro oven  apple door locker  apple dishwasher  apple washing machine  apple air purifier  apple light    many more  but the question is what do we mean by ecosystem   here by ecosystem we mean display to display share   actually so   i think smart things are one of the best   biggest ecosystem nowadays 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one of the biggest reasons ive stayed on android is apps but not because of the play store  the fact ive got the freedom to download off the web is nice
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,budget
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,never any bloat ware ever  just bloat songs
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dislike the iphone   will never go back  android is my blood 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,conclusion=    thanks me later 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,he didnt even put up the cameras
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as a mobile app developer  rn  ios is my winner  ios is so much more consistent imo
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,same old reasoning  just a duplicate video
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,excitement was basically a rehash of features
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the lack of a universal back button is absolutely unforgivable on an iphone  you have to figure out a way to go back in each app  on android  its one single gesture and so easy to use  i dont know what people are talking about iphone just works  i dont restart my android phone for months and still dont have any issues 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,next question to tackle  is it better to leave my pc on or off when not in use 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how tf do i stop youtube from automatic selecting the spanish audio track  its getting kinda annoying everytime i one one of your videos 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use  a keypad mobile is also easier to use so ill give point to it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if apple gives me the luxury to play with my file manager like how android does it  id then consider switching to an iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is a crappy ad for me to go buy a phone  they all suck
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro android has focus mode
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a telling omission  privacy
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,would like your view on the new huawei mate  marques 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my only real gripe with this is apps   im watching on youtube vanced   i watch a lot of youtube and i sideload a few apps in this same boat  gcam on my galaxy    apps for me is a toss up category   iphone has a better store but man having app options outside the store is really nice 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use just isnt for me then  i agree with the rest though so its kinda tough with some but theres a preference for everyone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a huge category that was missed is  security privacy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,not being captive by an ecosystem is the best  with apple you have to use it  so android wins hands down
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple has a sattelite sos feature which is insane  and i hate apple by and large 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the apps category should go to android dont just think about the playstore
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the little math part made me go for apple        but i´ll still go for android because of some things i hate about iphones    battery sucks   too closed system for me   too expensive
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,need a  projectfarm head to head 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,app goes to android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,out of all of the fonts apple deems me allowed to use on the home screen  none are appealing to me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, mkbhd you forgot to mention that android seamlessly integrate with windows
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, mkbhd you forgot to mention that android seamlessly integrate with windows
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i prefer android because i can play counter strike source and minecraft java on it
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,people just completely miss how good shortcuts app is   i could just yell hey siri code red and it will erase my brave browser history or walk into the house and lights will turn on and spotify starts playing  automated message  just underrated
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive been a iphone user forever  recently switched all my devices to samsung  for me  the only thing i miss on the apple ecosystem  is the apple watch  no equivalent good enough for the android world in my opinion  the rest  when i get home  immediately i get a notification to use my phone as a tv remote on my samsung tv  the integration between samsung devices is amazing  yes  id sometime in the future  switch back to the apple world  but for me  i dont miss the feeling of anxiety to change my iphone every year bc everyone around me is upgrading and ill get behind  every android user has their own favorite brand  wich has its own features and their own personality  i surely wont miss that 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,yup its the apple ecosystem for me  however ive always been super impressed and admired androids crazy or really cool features that their devices have  i dont plan to change anytime soon but i do need a secondary phone for work now and that z flip  has full attention 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple wins dont it  mkbhd is genius 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my top category is  imessage  id switch if it worked well with iphone from android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,heres my based  year old technology enthusiast  electronic device connoisseur   youtube enjoyer and part time pc nerd opinion  if you want a clean looking smooth experience buy an iphone     buy top iphone for business   if you want an optimized tryhard experience buy an android [if you dont understand buy iphone]  when i was  i got all my pocket money and some money that i earned and picked a xiaomi mi  which was around   at the time with vat it was so cool to me but it just felt cheap compared to my uncles iphone  pro max that just felt so incredible  the mi  got stolen  years ago either on the bus or at school now i have an sfe that i also spent my money on and it doesnt have the premium feel that i so desperately need  i have an amazing new pc setup with the best peripherals imaginable and expensive is definitely the way to go  if you will buy a new phone dont cheap out  you will not be happy with your   budget phone that weighs  grams  gets super hot  takes  seconds to unlock  freezes when you press too many buttons  and is made out of polycarbonate   you will definitely be happy with your quick  repsonsive  hz   heavy duty metal phone literally gets cold if you dont touch it for a long time   i will be getting the iphone  pro max for my th birthday as its almost family tradition at this point because all of my cousins have received the top model iphone at the time on their th brithday  you will have your phone with you   having a nice feeling premium phone just feels great   if youre older than  buy your child or niece and nephew a new phone if theyre above the age of  and relatively responsible  you dont need one and trust me they will be so greatful and much more happy than you  also you wont utilise it   so its just wasted   its  am dont judge me for typing this long im procrastinating sleep and this topic is very interesting to me at this point in time and i like to write down my opinions 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  again ease of use is terrible for a large phone and have to swipe with one hand from left to right  please apple let us change this  also  add punctuation or even an email with the   sign terrible  not easy to use
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  i disagree two major features that iphone does not have is   the ability to swipe right to left  i use my right hand to swipe out of a message  cant do it on iphone  i talked to many genius and  nope     keyboard with punctuation and numbers royal pain for right hander 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is the definition of value  what you pay vs what you get  what you get is up to you to determine what matters most and least 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i like the last part  i might have used that way on weighing before when selecting android or iphone  thanks marques
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,he already knew how iphone  is gonna be  maybe showing the missing features in iphone  and supporting it when iphone  releases  i’m just making fun
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,your choice is made on behalf   you never worked
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its seems the plot twist got my expectations 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i hate that i have to toggle keyboards on an i phone just to add a period to a sentence  i also cant stand how they charge for whatsapp  i love apples ipad and macbooks though 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,markas
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i use an iphone because of its simplicity and it just works  had an android for several years and i’ll never go back  i build custom pc’s  use an macbook for other applications and simply want ease of use with my phone… i just want the damn thing to work 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,he ain’t selling out apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as a business owner  i give iphone the win simply because it what everyone uses by far  sending things to an android user from an iphone presents lots of issues  i have used both the main reason i switched back from android to an iphone  my iphone makes my life a lot easier to use and its what most all of my customers and family have  so iphone wins by the number of people that use it so popularity wins  whenever i see green text message i’m like ugh  android user  i always reply to the user i’m sorry…… lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ugh  another android vs  apple video  whats next  mkbhd making yet another video on this overdone topic  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,that closing was smooth  lol   i wanna see a view on the ecosystem 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  facts 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’ve had both over the years  and i always go back to an iphone  primarily for the fact that it just works  rarely do i have an issue with apps crashing  needing to restart  or hardware issues  as you mentioned  android has so many different phones that it’s difficult to be reliable
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,   neither os is really missing any gigantic features anymore  wait  i would argue that we cant talk to our phone and have it actually do meaningful things for us is a huge missing feature  especially in light of llm 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,only the iphone in its original version can be auctioned for thousands… does any android do that  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i could have seen apps go either way  but heres my perspective  the largest difference for me on quality isnt necessarily ease of updating  personally app dev for ios was more of a pain than developing for android  though issues with continuity is real  apple has a much more rigorous  and expensive  verification process for apps  which filters out some cheaper apps  the main reason ive heard in the industry is that app dev targets ios because they can make more money  the counter argument is that ios cant sideload apps  that takes the difference of  million and increases it pretty drastically  the early better features on ios for major apps is definitely a factor though for your average person  like i said i see both sides 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great review  only thing that needs to be pointed out is the number of free apps  flexibility of using any app on your phone  think android scores tons above 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marques  where is your huawei mate  review 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one more apple promotion video just before iphone launch  well played 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would   buy a samsung if they had their own os  i prefer ios because of the optimization  if samsung phones had the same optimization  it would definitely destroy iphone in almost every single way
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love the folding phones  but i get overwhelmed with android’s customization  every time i get an android i move back to iphone  this just validated my feelings  i am but a simple user who just wants my phone to be pretty haha
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hahah this is the first video that you made that make me thining if the politics is something for you 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,me here knowing ill never switch to a different os  but still watching anyway
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i used iphone before  then i used samsung and never went back to iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,most people wont care  but if security is truly your overriding objective as it should be for people in todays world  irrespective of everything else  there is only one winner 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,video glitch at face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,cutest mascot category  android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nobody mentions how you can save a lot of money on android just dowloading music  games free  saving time with better files transportation 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i spent  years with android  switched to ios and never going back
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,man with all respect but no one can offer you an ecosystem of apple in their companies   works   etc its only for people who are interested in tech and in apple specifically   we need an ecosystem where i can use my phone with different types of devices specially in work and multitasking    i respect people who are used to their apple ecosystem and its affordable for them   put ecosystem category definitely is not for apple if youre considering normal people and their requirements for freedom in use  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,killed it with the ending  great job 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,multitasking  baby  thats why im still with android  im watching youtube while on a call 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would use apple  but i dont want to be locked into a realy pricy phone for years because i cant afford a new one   i mostly just talk  text   shop and yourube im useing a   nokia and its working
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a lot of indians men would get divorced if their spouses laptop auto sync to their phones  the apple ecosystem isnt for us 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,id argue that sideloading shouldve been mentioned in the apps section  generally agree with the observations made  but theres so much thats not available on vanilla non jailbroken non circumvented ios  like  emulators  youtube  re vanced  de listed apps games  etc
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, since were not psychos  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  this is a lie  ios is too complicated to use  for example unlocking one  and opening the app overview
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so heres the solution  buy  flagship from both
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,yeah at the end  it all depends on what you like  these youtubers are aging like eddie murphy making these stupid videos once every year 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’m a music lover so i collect all my favorite tunes and keep ‘‘em on my phone for easy access  always a win since i don’t need a streaming service to get that song so my data is long lasting  if only samsung or any other android manufacturer had an itunes like system i would switch in a heartbeat because i can organize my music to my own taste and feels  if it wasn’t for that and also the fact apps are smoother in ios i would change back to android i’ve tried unsuccessfully 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why is iphone the best for a cloud gaming what is the exact reason 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,am already used to android interface  i just wish android will have one community regardless of the android phone u use 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,excitement is not a factor  ecosystem should never be judged on its own  apps on android are as infinite as there are keyboard warriors  updates mostly do not matter  ease of use is extremely subjective and the entry difficulty should be a factor for tech people 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,to me for a daily user  the eco system is non existent  we have iphones and ipads and an imac in the house and never use the whole eco system thing  i see this more for businesses  big or small  for ease of use  yes out of the box  download your favorite apps and just have them all on the home screen to use  apple is probably better   just a little  because if you do the same on an android you can just use it  but with android customization  you can tailor your phone how you want it and then everyday use is just as easier or easier  but where i find apple not easy to use  is when you dive into the menus  some things are just impossible to find or it is   levels deep  where android is laid out nice and informative 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you dont like android  can you please give your pixel phone for me as a giveaway  becouse i have no budget for brought a pixel phone  mkbhd this is not a joke  i am seriously say this 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, customer service  yes  north américa and europe  come here and try to repair a mac  officially 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,mate  pro review 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think more tech reviewers should take repairability into account when making these comparisons 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think andriod   from experience on both  andrioid is just ad machine  customise your phone now  ad after ad 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,that mac pro flower pot though
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why is every youtuber comparing ios to android right before launch of new iphone   makes you wonder 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i appreciate you and your thoughtful commentary about different technologies  im an android user who started my nature photograpy journey on a samsung galaxy s  cell phones have come a long way   i prefer to use my samsung galaxy s plus to capture butterflies  bees  lizards  flowers  insects  and other small  easy to miss beauty  my work phone was an iphone and i didnt like the output of pictures that it captured 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps on ios is expensive  can easily get it free on android  you can even mod it yourself 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marques is a pm at heart
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’m easy these days because it’s all changing year on year  i’m an iphone user and lover  it’s easy and straightforward  love android too but i’m happy right now  and variety better 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would argue that apples borders around their ecosystem makes it a negative point  they cannot even make an app for their streaming service that works on my phone  d would have loved if you said for ecosystem it is   pts for each  but with your personal weighting this or that is the winner  breaking a tie just to have a result  the rating of this video will show how smart of a choice that was i guess  thanks for the video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone more updates  with nothing but slowing your phone down so you buy a new one  and features android already had a year ago   every iphone is the same as the last one   zero innovation  no folds or shapes   iphone ecosystem is the worst in existence   i dont care what it costs as i run flagships only and they cost more than iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the complete lock in to  do it apples way  is the fact that i find so offputting with ios  something as simple as wanting to move some audio files to the phone  just plug it in via usb and transfer  apple  not so much  apple tries to make things easy but they wind up throwing roadblocks at people who know what they want to do  also  iphones are deathly boring  they barely change at all  you can get an iphone from  and its the same as todays  boring 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dope framework minded video  creative  objective  slightly controversial  and as always  interesting 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,just before the launch of the new iphone  ok how much did they pay you for this 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the biggest thing missing from this video is imessage  having those extra features and seamlessness for texting is a deal breaker for a lot of people  also the green bubble shame 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love the objective breakdown in the end  because you already knew people were going to bring the pitch fork after the initial analysis  and yes  we  the people   are the real winners because they bend to our needs  so we are just simply taking advantage of their little  whos better  game they playing  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,keep in mind that the samsung ecosystem has other elements to it beyond computers  cellphones and accessories  for example  i can turn my tv on using my galaxy watch with smartthings
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so basicly iphone has won the usa  and android won the world 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,even with the basic comparison  android is easier to use for me so android wins
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,mkbhd is maturing  finally  android is for the creative  and the iphone is for the business person 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think functionality should be on the list as well  yes the android has tons more customization but none of it works as well as apples smaller list of customization  i’ve had both for a long time as well   the glitches hiccups or shitty optimization of all the cool shit on the android makes it pointless to me  customization is pointless without optimization 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,definitely want a video comparing the ecosystem of apple and samsung
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when it comes to the category of status  which would you say wins 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i feel like for better or worse  once you go iphone  or at least have had one for as long as me  since original launch  you can’t realistically switch to anything else without a major headache or feeling major investment loss    at this point i’ve spent hundreds if not   over the last  years on apps and itunes music  in probably the last holdout of actually buying itunes music and having it on my phone   computer  i keep my phone plan cheap by having my music always downloaded  never streaming  plus i like having a library  so unless apple really screws up and makes a ton of terrible decisions  i for sure will never be switching to android and losing all of that investment  even if it is  possible    features of both phones really balance out  and i don’t have the time to really care that much about a phone and how i’m using it  it’s just a daily piece of tech  it runs the apps i need  can get in touch with people  and takes fine photos  i don’t care about the most modern features  i have standalone cameras  audio junk  everything else  so i personally love that apple still does the se versions of the phones  that’s all i need  and i’ve been getting a good   years out of each phone  and never because they break  just because i am just wanting something a little snappier 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i like how you did this   very informative and helped me know that what i use is the best choice for my needs 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the winner is the friends we made along the way 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android user has a full access to phone files and system unlike ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps must go to android cuz u cant install what ever u want in ios only app store apps
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hey awesome video what macbook should you recommend me to get for college 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont know if other android series or iphones have this feature  i really like how my pixel  pro has the ability to steadily charge my phone to   overnight until my morning alarm  it helps not to overcharge it and keeps the battery healthy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you missed the size factor  no small phones created by android anymore iphone  mini is the only option in the market  mind boggling
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i do see the point  ecosystems are different  sure  apple products work great with apple but for me  the ecosystem ends not by the phone manufacturer  for me all the products from any manufacturer that work with a product are relevant   using an iphone with a mouse  think still not there  there are thousands of devices working perfectly with android  except for external gps receivers  i think they still only work with apple  i would say that should be undecided 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,like almost all reviews  its flawed  there is no way to compare an iphone to an android  iphones are devices  android is an operating system  so yes  you can compare an apple iphone  to a google pixel  or a samsung galaxy s but each of them has pros and cons   generally  ios  the operating software that runs iphones  offers less features  less customization and flexibility but is more reliable and has a quicker time to patch and longer software update life cycle   android allows each manufacturer  and end user  to heavily customize their experience and has more features  albeit some are duplicates or somewhat pointless   given a price point   theres no clear winner between an iphone and a comparable android based device  its a matter of preference and priorities   if youre a mac user  using icloud  apple music  and really have no tech aptitude   iphones integration and one size fits all approach is for you   if you are a windows or linux user and prefers customization   android based phones are a better fit for you 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is god and android is the devil respectably 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the samsung ecosystem works even better with their smart home devices  eg  tvs  also on xiaomi  eg  router  just makes fixing a problem or setting something up way more convenient even more than an apple ecosystem 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you caught me off guard at the end 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,current android phones run smoothly without freezes  glitches or errors 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love tech and i also love freedom  android gang 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the review for ios is so thorough that devs almost hate it  they really make sure that the app is good enough for the app store  which produces good quality apps as well  cant say the same about android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no matter what set of metrics you choose  nothing iphone does  better  will ever make up for how blatantly apple condescends to the consumer  seriously  ill never understand why millions of people continue to pay a premium for a single oem to dictate so much of how they communicate etc  its bizarre 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im a little surprised at some of the things that were straight up ignored    for apps  quality may be better but quantity is still a factor  android has a gigantic lead in user base so its not all that uncommon to find apps that just dont exist on ios  sure  all the major u s  dominant apps exist but that feels so  unnecessary limiting    but the piece i think im most surprised he ignored is rd party acceptance in ecosystems  have a samsung phone but dont want to be in their ecosystem  just buy any other android accessory  whereas apple will seemingly actively punish users for buying outside their exclusivity or who try to use apple products outside the ios sphere  linus sebastian rants frequently about how the apple watch limits functionality if youre not using it on ios    so while apple may be more seamless  theyre also suffocating in their control  remember the old apple slogan   think different  except nowadays if you want even the ability to consider to think different  you need to be on android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,blue dominates the green in mkbhds setup
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,compare any iphon with huawei mate pro and you will realise iphone is piece of crap
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple fan boy l 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,oh my i loved this video  what a catchphrase   at the end  the winner is you  and that is so true  love you
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for the support one while its great that the old iphones get the latest software updates in many cases it makes the device worse and slows it down
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro what’s the song in this video
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i find the iphone much more difficult to use than android  for me android is much easier  and i think its unfair to give the ecosystem point to ios  the android ecosystem  from samsung for example is much better and bigger 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as someone who doesnt daily drive an iphone i   disagree that apple wins on ease of use  blatantly not having a back button built right into every app is pure stupidity  minimalism is terrible when it destroys basic functionality  ive never had to google how to use basic functions of a phone with android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung has focus modes
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,good video  i hobestly like both phones  so i always have the latest flagship from apple and samsung  i will say though  i enjoy my su more  goodlock is amazing  i use dex all of the time  i use my stylus quite a bit as well  and the main problem i had with android devices in the beginning is no longer an issue  which was the degredation of the phone itself    i remember i bought the galaxy s and in  months it ran like shit  but i still use my iphone daily for work and music related things 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for the apps  youtube revanced android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video  amazing video quality 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,caveat for the  apps  is that apple actively takes features out of google apps like maps and calendar  so if you’re using googles suite over apple’s on an iphone  you’re missing some features 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lovely video and breakdown  thanks for putting the time and effort into putting it out  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you cant use ecosystem to compare android and ios   for android devices that is manuafacturer dependent  which there are a gazillion  with ios there is only one 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,big key feature that you never mentioned is apples wallet which digitize any ticket receipts to be used at an airline  movies  vendor  with location notifications on your lock screen for ease of use  im an android feature for a long time but damn do i miss this feature  no android comes close to this for some reason 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,someone got paid for sure  another one that have failed under money corruption  meh
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you talk about continuity in the ecosystem  have you ever tried to charge all of your apple devices with  cable  no  you cant  you need magsafe on your older macbook  you need usb c for your ipad  you need lightning for your phone  you need a special puck charger for you apple watch  some devices support wireless charging and some dont  its a joke  go to the google or samsung ecosystem and you use  cable  they win by far  anybody who cares that much about a blue bubble or whatever color it is  is a shallow individual that i dont want to be friends with anyways  android wins the ecosystem argument hands down  and the apps  as a software developer i can tell you that you are dead wrong  we update our android apps first  as do most  it may be the basic android phone app first  not the tablet foldable tv versions  but the basic phone one is updated first  and have you ever tried to use any app on the ipad that is not designed for it  crap  android wins hands down in the app category  this should be a v not a v
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,also  i currently have a mid range phone from  that stopped updating with android  but i can upgrade it to android  thanks to custom roms
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i died at the  siri  why arent you better  shot  i literally say that to siri every day  she sucks and its frustrating
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no t dialing in iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i see why people are all up in arms about this video especially the  ease of use  part  mkb had this part wrong though  aside the us  old folks are using android phones without issues 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,asthetics change after android upgrade are very nice
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,fairphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apples ecosystem is the sole reason i am switching after having android since  years old till now that i am   knowing that i will start to get scammed  have less features  have a dumber phone that is more sophisticated  at some point my whole family has iphones and google meet barely works right  you cant send clear videos with one another that you just have to make the switch  its almost like the people around you dictate if you get iphone not for the  popularity  or trying to be  cool  like them but for connectivity  sometimes you just want to facetime your mother and know that it will go through 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my mans hitting ecosystem on the head perfectly 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thanks to android beeing opensource  software updates are indeed possible for phones older than  years  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple = blue pill android = red pill  ease of use    i can literally take my samsung note  ultra g anywhere in the world and get service without a problem  whether its repairs or data  it is the most easy to adapt to in other countries  upgrades   support    since apple just lost a lawsuit from throttling older phones  that should be enough to give this category to android  especially when compared to samsung flagships   apps   xbox game pass on my note  ultra g [drops microphone]  facetime is irrelevant because video calling has been around forever  apple just have it a catchy name
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, apple builds bigger walls around keeping people into their ecosystem   yep   and thats the only reason i dont have an iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,funny u followed up the apps part with excitement  because u did kind of excite me right before to get on my samsung flip pair it with a watch and try to find a diamond or two in the rough on that app store  i want to dive in now and go from ease of use to more features and customization for a bit  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me  i love using my iphone but there are some missing features that make my experience incomplete  so  i end up coming back to android  even in android  i end up with one ui which im bored with but is the best one for my needs   for example  i love how the pixels os looks but i hate that while clicking a long screenshot  pixel creates  pictures and dont get me started on the lack of folders  somehow samsung just does it better 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why is this still a debate  smartphone has gotten so good that you cant go wrong with either choice 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thanks for great content that i care about all the time marques 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i haven’t been able to put my  promax down for my flip z since they both released… even though i live that z too  battery life on that promax and the camera just hit different  really the ui too… unless i’m using ios theme on my android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,yeah  great customer support  when it not comes to reliability  ease of replacement and repair  expendability and openness of ecosystem   mkbhd
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as someone who has been trying both my conclusion would be this  android because options  if you want the apple experience of it being simple  just get a samsung  you want custom  anything else in android  because iphone is like a screwdriver with  bits in a handle drawer while android is like a tool box  in which there is always something for everyone  at different prices 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,updates security matters in the current world of hacks and viruses  as such  this will mean  points alone for iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone   for the people who can afford android slightly_smiling_face 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,whole point of this video is pointless
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hey can u talk about huawei mate

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,football has taught me that even when someone or something is way better  people will still find something weird to debate   messi is goat 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is like aol  whilst android is everyone else
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so you give the app advantage to iphone even though android can have the apks installed that arent even in the store  you just casually  forgot  about that  as a pro apple youtuber 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,he is richer than elon musk   that he could buy every new phones 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is what logic looks like  great video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung all the way i cant even look at apple products i will never switch to ios im android for life particularly samsung
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the winner is the friends we made along the way
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nahhhh app can’t ever ever go to the iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why are you using google foldable  show samsung one all the apps are well optimised for the inner screen youtube instagram all the app and i think android is more easy to use every single thing in apple is so compacted from downloading a file or to set up a wallpaper you download in i pads its in america only that people are so attached to i message or other thing there are  better options then apples  app which other countries use like whatsapp the whole ecosystem thing  is bullshit for both android and apple they both want us to spend more money on there products   which comes with a premium  just to give you little bit of ease 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hi  i bought new phone realme  pro and instead of  w charger i got w charger  is it ok to use this charger  will it take long or else time to charge because my support w charger  please someone respond
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,id argue that the point about apples customer service only applies to the us  in my country  for example  there is only one single applestore  but at least a samsung repair centers in any city  apple customer service is done exclusively though mail and it takes a looooooong time 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,click bait  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,not having separate controls for the volume of media alarm ringtone shutter in ios is one of these  oh wow  it cant do what  things
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is  times better than ios android can sometimes dual boot other operating systems android has the option of installing custom os  its limitless tweaking with android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,superbly well rounded video  i have to say that i totally agree with everything been said 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for the easy to use part  we forgot an android big winner  the back button and the  no gesture  navigation  my mom is so reassured by having a home button and a back one 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,products google  no thanks 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im an android user  always have been  and one of my biggest peeves with android is software updates  if you choose not to automatically update or dont realize youve set for that  you need to do the update update by update  you dont just get to jump to the newest update and move on  you update and then do the next  and the next and so on  apple did it right and you shoot to the newest ios when you ask for it and ios does it all for you  you dont spend    hours getting caught up like us android users  i also say this because i work in a store that deals for a canadian telecom  elderly clients will come in with issues and   of the time its because it hasnt been updated in a year and a half  just my  cents 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,perfect comparation and the end is sensacional  that is the truth now  you need to decide what is important to you instead keep following what some people tells you to do  thanks mark for this amazing video
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for the app or maybe update category  we should talk about how ios users have to download large files all over again when updating apps with extra files  for example codm on android gets like mb download ios gets gb+ because theyre basically downloading all over again 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,stretching topic just for views
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i feel that software updates on iphone  especially version changes  are not always looking at the older device hardware  they are designed for the latest or  models which obviously have higher performance  this will cause the older phones to lag in many of actions while they have the latest updates 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as for the apps and accessories   android has an edge in niche things  like low latency gps can be connected only to android app  same with nfc applications and lots of stuff which should work in background
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont know if this is supposed to be even acknowledge but what about the ability to install any program you want even what is not on the app store for android  since last i heard you couldnt on iphone unless you take non tos routes  please correct me if im wrong since im not sure  thank you 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,   thats correct  im on android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i still remember this guy voted iphone for customization over android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, apple stores are everywhere  said like a true new yorker who has never visited the middle of america
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is everywhere   even if youre a die hard apple geek  youre bound to be using an android device somewhere in your life   not true the other way around  thats what i call flexibility  android wins 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,app quality iphone >> android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in the feature category  you cover mostly customizations
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,got them both
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive used both  and personally like android better  but what i really want to a new windows phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,absence of an ecosystem is the primary reason why i use android  am not chained to compulsive buying behaviour  keep it simple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i find android phones and tablets extremely clunky to use and after a year their performance degrades a lot  i can’t believe this was not mentioned  the build quality of iphones and ipads is vastly superior to any android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how about real categories that matter  unlike the garbage ecosystem  like price  or design  or build quality  cuz apple loses in every single one of these compared to poco alone  let alone all android brands  man  you guys are so biased towards apple  its like they brainwash you through fomo
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,software updates  fair phone will give you updates until   so yeah 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,focus modes have been on android forever  what are you even talking about  you even have work profiles and different profiles to allow access to different users 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you usually throw in repairability in these videos  you conveniently have been leaving it out lately  come on marquees 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple stores are not everywhere 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,k dislikes  a lot of apple fanboys are not happy
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,mkbhd is out of new video ideas
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have been an iphone user for years now  switiching over from andriod due to features such as airdrop and apple music  but i must say   apple watches   iphones and  macs later  i am more ready than ever to give up apple altogether  living in south africa  there isnt a single official apple store in the country   several istores  which are official resellers  but no apple stores  these istores do not have any contact numbers or emails  so getting a device checked out for issues or getting any support whatsover  requires driving + minutes to get to a store  then waiting in line until its your turn   bc its first come first serve  and this can take hours if not days  where they just say sorry they are all booked up for the day and you need to come back some other day  then the help is generally so pathetic you cant even believe  calling apple results in stupid wait times and phone bills because there is just a lack of care and understanding  repair costs and the fact that device prices just go up without much new innovation or improvement makes me have a fundamental disagreement with the ethics of the company  will be switching to andriod at the first opportunity 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,before i watch the video i see k downvotes  this is going to be good 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,grinning_squinting_face 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you have missed the important aspect   innovation   apple has lost it   i am a hard core fan of apple and seeing the same phone from iphone  and nothing changed even for      also they reduce the power and performance if it gets older which is really bad  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,everything the andriod now have  apple will later introduce them to the people at a higher price in later ios  theres nothing really new from them  lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i cant believe you left out multi tasking on android  theres no way apples exo system can touch androids  especially not samsungs  as you stated  apple puts up a wall around their ecosystem  but android has duo  which allows everyone on the planet to video chat  i use both  but the wall around apples platform annoys me sometimes  so yea  by having google duo on android and the keyboard options would put android on top for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have focus mode on my android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i was an annoying apple hater for  years  i realized that as i got older my relationship with my phone has changed  i went from using   of androids capability to about   i went from a full blown power user to an enthusiast  so now im in a happy market of both systems appealing to my tastes and needs  its great to leave hate behind   but as an agent of chaos  i love to be the green bubble fucking up the group chat 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,purpose of the video exactly 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video  iphone is the winner 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,before i start  or read comments  my assumption is  the real winner is us  the consumers 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you should give a point for upgrading to android because you get all the latest features in these updates   whats the point of getting another ios update on an older device if the latest features are only available on the latest devices 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple app store is horrible in ukraine  a lot of the apps and games missing  also nobody uses imessage or facetime  but most people you’ll see on the street use iphone just as a brag  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you missed the most important category of all and thats price  most android users will not buy an iphone because its just too expensive   you can get a very good new android phone for   this simply doesnt exist for iphone  i would be very happy to switch to iphone if there was a cheap  good  iphone  the iphone se is outdated crap 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,love high res videos man
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,believe me  imessage is only popular in north america and not such widespread in other parts of the world
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so this video was just a whole lot of nothing thank you marques
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple bricked by iphone  pro max with software update to ios  yellow screen of death due to a low quality display they used now asking for    for fixing that something  thats their fault and  mkbhd please look into this in india its worse and there is no support from apple they just want money in return for something thats their fault  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ill add a category  how well your phone ages  + years on an old iphone is very similar to what you get on a new iphone   thanks to ios   smooth  flowy and nippy  android phones on the other hand do not age well 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i barely look at my phone   mostly when im in commute for communication   both os are awful and very weak which makes them being some toys  the smart attribute is laughable    so any phone you get in your pocket is going to do exactly the same thing
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,perfect answer 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,not sure how aple won apps category  you cant sideload apps there  there are no rd party app stores 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think one not named advantage for android is that you can get an android phone new for under  dollars  that can basically do almost all of the stuff a   device can do 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if u wanna know the answer  give a  to  score to each of the categories based on how important each category is for you  then  give a  to every winner in each category and another number you think is fair to the loser coz it cant be  for android for excitement and  for iphone  iphone should still get like  or   then multiply and sum up  and you get the winner
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thats how you know you shouldnt listen to him at all when  affordability  wasnt even a category  ecosystem should not have been a category if youre comparing a brand to an operating system  ecosystem would have to be brand vs  brand apple dominates im not questioning it  not something like apple vs linux  makes no sense  when it comes to the us  apple edges out android taking up   of smartphones  cough  middle class  cough   but what about the rest of the world  android takes up   of smartphones worldwide  not because they hate apple  but a lot of times its the only thing they can afford  when it comes to connecting people of world and giving them the ability to communicate at nearly any price  nothing comes close to android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,he worked up and chose war
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you didnt talk about price battery designs etc
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no one who is  tech interested  and under  goes with the iphone…
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in china many people just buy both phones because even though they prefer iphone for all its merits  they need some functions iphone doesn’t have  such as twin apps  two wechat apps in one phone  and call recordings  and almost no one uses imessage or facetime because of wechat  so it’s wechat that helps android phones win  plus  with   you can buy ten android phones here 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the issue is not all androids have all features  wherein most new iphones have these features it’s iphones vs like  other companies on the feature front
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,personally love android freedom also variety in phone capabilities and prices
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,here is simple answer to that   if you’re using it just as a phone   iphone ios wins  if you use it as a tool and a phone then android wins  simple as that
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im getting  mrwhosetheboss vibes
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is best for productivity and android is best for everything elese including a major portion of productivity  so if affordability is not an issue android is the winner 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple software is always worse when it comes to user experience 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think you missed the mark on the apps category  if the reasoning on why apps are  better  on ios is updates are prioritized on it  wouldnt it fall under the category named  updates support  idk  just seems like the apps category wasnt really about the apps and more about the support  when it comes to apps  especially when you install  uptodown app store  it doesnt even come close 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,respectfully i think your way off with the ecosystem analysis  you can tell because you switched to calling it the  samsung ecosystem not  android eco  which is way bigger  better and diverse  yes the apple eco connects seamlessly  but if im telling someone to invest in an ecosystem  android provides so much choice for both budget oriented individuals and high rollers with many brands not just samsung  involved and integrated  you cant throw a rock without finding something that will connect to your android eco   cost is a major metric that should will always be in there  for my grandma in law  we suggested an easy to use ipad for her but the cost was too much so android was the choice   otherwise a great video and the weighting system is a great idea to finalise someones decision 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,andriod will always have an edge over iphone over modded apps  which makes out life much easier without ads and we can always downlaod any movie or tv show in an andriod quite easily  which is the main fucntion of a smartphone so basically with even a cheap andriod u can enjoy all that a expensive iphone or andriod can do and youl not have to worry about your money when your display breaks and cost you a heap load of money 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,classy  between the  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im going to have to disagree pretty hard on the  apps  category  there are a few apps that are crucial for my job that are not supported by macos or ios  thats an instant dealbreaker for any company in my industry  and id assume its the same for many other industries  just because all of the major social media apps are supported by both platforms  it doesnt mean that is all that matters 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,make a video on xperia  v  i think sony took your advice on it
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is good for someone who doesnt regularly use deferent types of computers  who needs a good budget camera  and doesnt care about customization  iphone can even fail to do simple things like saving a file from internet  file manager is terrible  customizing the phone  themes from other developers  is impossible  theres a gap between ios and ipad os  no desktop feature  i have both phones  but android is better  and its future is getting brighter evry other day that passes 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,everytime mkbhd makes one of these  he tries so hard to make the iphone compete  some of the points he gave it felt so forced 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive got to hard disagree on giving the apps win to apple  on android i can install apps from wherever i want  i can install modded apps  and run emulators  having to stick within apples tight set of rules for the app store is a complete deal breaker
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so basically apple is communist
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is customizable but ease of use is in iphone  does it make sense 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think price is a factor that most people consider
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i cannot believe my eyes  but is that a post prod overlay at    guess you’re not gods of video editing  after all  demigods  maybe 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dont forget the fingerprint sensor  especially  during covid it was very annoying not to have it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i tried to deep dive into the samsung ecosystem in a span of  months  i really did give it a try  surprisingly  ease of use  updates support  apps  that rarely or really do not crash or get a bug  and the ecosystem made me realize that i preferred apple over samsung  it always boils down to personal preference  no need to wage war over this matter 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i wish data privacy was included as a factor 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is the most perfect tech video of u ive ever watched 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,here in mexico nobody uses facetime or imessage  everyone uses whatsapp
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,awesome
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,us not the world  there are more then  countries here
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,can the iphones multitask  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think you didnt did justice to apps section  people from east like pakistan  india use andriod more than ios  so in terms of getting apps to more people  developer release apps for android first and ios get usually months or sometime years later  and you shouldnt make videos thinking about just americans or west  like you said if you jus want to get a phone and forget it you get ios  thats where americans shine  other than that i thinks android wins  in terms of where people put their money  i know price matters too but still
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,yet the instagram app on my ipad is not optimised  but it is for the mi and samsung tabs  idk how the apps point went to apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have doubts about the ease of use of iphones  how do you turn auto brightness on or off  let me help you  go to settings > accessibility > auto brightness  i can’t imagine why apple can’t put that simple setting under display   brightness 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,excitement should go to apple   nobody excited for some folding phone or whatever  interested to hear about them   yes  maybe  but excited    doubt  on every apple event at least   are android users  just to hear about what’s new  they may be not interested in buying one  but it always a wait for these shows  i am not even talking about how excited people who use apple products  so yeah  for me  this category is completely wide of mark  i agree with other tho 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive been using android since samsung s now rocking s ultra   d missus uses an iphone  and unfortunately her photo collection dates back to  i think  and often not  her storage becomes full  and the phone becomes sluggish   it has to do with how nvme reads memory  the electron   or something  moves much slower when nvme is full  hence why iphones should never be used exceeding   of storage   furthermore  we dont have a mac  only windows pcs at home and work   if she deletes the photos from the phone  it deletes from the icloud  her phone was basically useless for  days while the ios was busy pushing backup photos to the cloud  freeing up  then  gb  but the   thumbnails  will forever be in the photos app   also  icloud only allows  items to be manually downloaded to pc in zip folders     to transfer a collection of photos and videos from iphone to pcs  without the files gets jumbled up and named like encrypted files  you have to pay for an app  i had an iphone se once for youtubing  but sold it off when i encountered this problem   and the missuss problem becomes my problem   together with   live photos   that just eats up space  some default settings out of the box on iphones is ridiculous   eats up battery life with lift to wake   easts up storage space with live photos  android phones will never have storage issues because    you can safely transfer all your photos to the cloud   google photos     click overnight  then google photos ai will delete    duplicates from your phones   duplicates from whatsapp   duplicates received elsewhere  you can free up your storage  you can  click transfer everything to the pc overnight   iphone and itunes will have   connection   issues    you can access whatsapp media files via gallery and even windows to clean up your phone  also other benefits of android  type c drag and drop file system fast charging fast transfer whatsapp  the ability to download from the browser  access it  sideload it etc  like an actual pc  a real smartphone   android is available in tvs  android tv boxes  and integration with smart devices and home appliances    android phones can easily share high resolution photos via whatsapp  so yeah  for me android is the best 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the world is not around america my friend  you only talking on behalf of the american people rest of them in android world  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is pure marketing jaggernaut  feature wise and value for your money you get more in android flagship phones  apple just knows how trap their users in their system  they stop innovating while a samsung ajdvhuawei are always trying to bring out something newn to the market 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why bro why 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marques should have read the comments of this video before uploading  thats where the real answer is 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how is the ecosystem usage cross platform is not easy and you are forced to buy the same platform gadgets 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,whoa at   your hand goes behind the computer screen in the background
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me what i like about iphone is its camera and it can play any games theres no lag or whatsoever  and on android after hearing about fairphone  that it will get  years of software update  i will stick more on to android  and because iphone is more expensive
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my takeaway is all of android vs apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,maybe it should be called  ios vs android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i had been using android up to   and using iphone for the last  years   there are only two features that i really miss    the keyboard  i type armenian a lot  the armenian keyboard is horrible on iphone  some weird arrangement without possibility to choose one you are used to  yes in armenian there are multiple arrangements of keyboard   if this is something you get used to during time there is something which is really a problem  it does not have autocorrect and gestures  and actually even autocorrect for english is not getting close to the quality of gboard  and unfortunately gboard for ios simply does not support a bunch of languages that it does on android  including armenian    the call history and the app itself  particularly the feature i miss the most is when you type a small part of the phone number you remember  on androids it makes suggestions from history  this is sooooo convenient  especially if you are doing a lot of calls to new phone numbers  and simply the history is supeeeer short 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video but the ease of use is the only win for ios  the positves here for ios are actually negatives for me     is the actual score for android   samsung tablets and phones and pixel phones are the clear android winners 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when i was using android phones that weren’t samsung  i used to download their internet and music apps because the default ones were pretty bad
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,definitive  wait until he does the same again next year  and the following and…
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i cant live without accessibility like live caption  you should include accessibility category
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lemme guess marques  the next video would probably start like   i’ve been using this iphone  pro for almost two weeks now 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have to have both  so i do  nowadays android is way better for business for me  i can sign pdfs so quickly  apple  can lock my kids phones and talk to them much easier 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,think you missed a very important category in reparability 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple casually taking on a  android brands single handed
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about performance  and cosistency 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have a startup company that is basically an app  and ios is the last priority  we will always be sure to have android working properly
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,here are we comparing ios vs android or apple vs other phones company that uses android plus their respective softwares  coz it seems different to me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i still use the blackberry bold 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about the price vs features you get  android win by  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of privacy  apple  android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i just wanna say that both are really cool
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hard pivot… k for a bed sheet 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is the best  you can finaly customize it to look like an iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is just for texting  thats all 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the split screen in s using one hand operation + is easily the best thing that a smart phone can have  if u map the swipes  a simple swipe down splits your screen and it becomes super easy to use multi window 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in short the best is in the eye of the beholder
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps goes to apple  i sold my device because theres not much variety of apps plus its strictness  android able to use outside play store apps tho  many company uses google workspace and android is really compatible with it too
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video  i honestly love competition because it always leaves the customer somewhere to run when they are let down  im an android user and i love the fighting to have the best camera hardware and software  gaming and overall specs  once again im super against monopolies so   great video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont know why big youtuber like this not tell true about this matter apple is better than android   how comes  for me android is better than apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  wait  my galaxy has modes  focus modes  its wonderful  have some for work  relax  night  driving 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung does technically makes speakers  just not bluetooth  and have been for awhile 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro android is easy used what saying
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,please make a video on huawei mate  pro
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,add the category cost   an important factor for   of people 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,doing a great showing of why your still the best 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android  all the way  usa is just a overated country
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i always like the shutter sound effect in these videos  it sounds just like my trusty nikon f
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the end made me laugh  i actually prefer android  because iphones irritate me with how little you can change it to your liking  i am rocking a galaxy s ultra and an iphone   ive got both worlds in my pocket  and   of the time i pull out my galaxy  better battery life  way better cameras  has a built in s pen  and charges ridiculously fast in a pinch  but you do you 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, minutes later  we’re back to square   great 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i honestly think you should do a separate video on galaxy touchwiz<one ui vs iphone ios because a lot of the consistency in ios has been in samsungs software from the beginning of the galaxy s   i think to some people samsungs software is more familiar than even generic android because most consumers that have had an android have basically had a galaxy  plus  samsung has more of the features that google doesnt offer  more developed ecosystem   more market share in general   especially in the us than even google   just my  cents 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i know people who had iphones and switched back to androids because everytime they turned around on their iphone either something was limited or they couldnt get into their phones via memory types of situations or they bumped the phone against something hard on accident and cracked it or broke it completely like an egg and when they went to tell the apple store associate it was an insurance issue or they got stuck having to buy a new iphone like its one of these plastic cars on the roads we drive today  one brush with something hard and off to the junkyard it goes then to get replaced by another more expensive iphone if they discontinued the one they had or theyll sell them a refurbished one  i always kept an android and love the fact that i have no insurance issues if i have a problem with my device or any restrictions via apps or customizations to my device  i currently have an lg stylo  ive had it for a while i m due for an upgrade since the network for lg phones arent as strong as most other phones in use and on the market now  im looking at a moto stylist  i did want the big boy samsung but the moto has some things the samsung doesnt plus they take great pics my son has one and its responsively quick he loves it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the most important factor for me is security   i was an android user and you will find tons of news about a lots of android apps with malware or virus   apple store bubble is more effective way to protect the users   not everyone is a tech wizard to read every app permissions    the other factor is customer service  is fast and reliable  i had to wait over  months for a google pixel replacement 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i could tell it was going to be an iphone  samsung gang 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios de iphone vs android sistemas operativos muy buenos
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use android  for me   iphone very complicated
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there should be special category for repairability
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,having a compact phone that would last a long time was important to me  so iphone  mini it was 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’ve literally never met a single person that gets excited about android phones  i literally work at a company that makes a android and ios app  lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marques mines a tie   what do i do lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung has a back bottom right on the screen  if that is not ease of use  i dont know what is
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,repairability is king  cracked glass  battery  i can get it fixed at a nearby shop for cheap with oem parts  winner is the one that actually gives power to the user rather than giving you no choice but iecosystem
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i only do android because i can install a apk from outside the play store and can install modded  apk
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i stick with iphone simply because i know i don’t need to buy another one for several years 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont understand why the price isnt on there
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in conclusion this are just tools you need everyday    dont become a fanboy   mkbhd
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,plz do the ecosystem vid
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the dragon ball phone case >>>>>>>>
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lets say that youre out of content 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i wish i had an android like i used to bc the game i want isn’t on ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone slow down your phone every single time they lunch a new phone and every year your phone feel slower  android dont do that 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,on the customization front  which bleeds into both features and apps  is if you dont like the stock android launcher  there are several alternative launchers in the play store   personally  i use nova launcher  and have over the past many phones  my android ux has stayed fairly constant over several phone manufacturers no matter what oem launcher they provide  is using an alternate launcher replacement possible on ios  im not trying to be a troll  i honestly dont know 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i switch back and forth because i hate the idea of being committed to one ecosystem of products  like  i buy my iphone  and then my homepod  and set up an apple smart home  and what if i dont like it later  or google has some smash success story  i have to re commit to an entire other ecosystem because their shit never plays together 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i knew he was going to say apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,who else skipped to the end  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would rather not have usb c  every time you drop a phone with usb c plugged into it  that’s the end of that cable  the lightning cable is much sturdier 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung has focus mode
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thats the first time i have heard someone say iphone xr correctly in years 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,such a nice unbiased video i usually get bored with the same stuff so i prefer customization therefore android for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is better than i phone in nearly every single aspect  better battery   better screen  expandable memory  headphone jack  removable battery  better camera  better processor  idk how iphone is superior
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,using iphone  pro rn and coming from a note  iphone just became so horrible compared to iphone  plus times  steve jobs cries
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its true what marques said about importance to where you live is really big  because where i live i have not seen one person using face time or the messages app on apple  we just use whatsapp for that
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lol about time i actually saw a video assigning a weighting to the categories to determine a winner
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lol about time i actually saw a video assigning a weighting to the categories to determine a winner
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,small correction  samsung has focus mode on their phones
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple slows down every single iphone every year  do i have to say more 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,peace 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple home is a horrible mess and they have no home products like samsung  idk why youd give them the ecosystem win when they have a godawful assistant and terrible integration with third parties 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hello fellow engineer hereslightly_smiling_facethumbs_up_medium light_skin_tone  just here passing on information so someone can get inspired to be a part of this industry moving forward
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the issue with the ecosystem every tech creators tends to forget is that not only  that its mainly north america that use all this facetime and imessage many other countries and continent use whatsapp and many other socials literally   literally only   is north america so thats not being conciderate
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,biggest customization is that you can literally change whole os on android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,surprised  camera video   wasnt one of your categories   for me android wins that one 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the best ecosystem is using my galaxy watch  and galaxy buds live with my pixel  pro  basically the best ecosystem is not made by apple will work with anything  and also downloading google messages and nearby share on my windows pc it all  just works 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me  aux port bluetooth is garbage  customization  expandable storage no notch solid camera battery life fast charging apps  updates support
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use to a generation mostly born with computers in the home is wild 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,focus modes are on android also multiple use profiles
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nerds always pick android over iphone  iphone is just for calls and camera and that ends there 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i cant believe ease of use is judged upon  among other non relevant factors a camera app that has stayed the same for  years and not accessibility features and how would users interact with a device if it was their time ever  android hands down wins  out of  categories  objectively  catching up on ecosystem as well  imagine someone steals your phone  on iphone it takes an hour to get in with appleid  fa  use another ios device  reset your password  get it to wipe or do the authentication  best case  android is tops min 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,does anyone know whats the intro song 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ecosystem is a double edged sword  in india  before g internet was cheap and widely available  android would be the winner in ecosystem
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,is the trashcan mac suspended in air 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,strangely enough my iphone se from  is still getting the odd security update this year
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the real winner is the friends we made along the way
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios is a shame 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it doesnt matter if android devices had a magical power  id still never own an android phone again 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think you forgot a few major important and universal points that affect everyone when choosing a phone because they are not just a phone anymore  data security   data recovery  we will all replace or loose our phones at some point   more   more each day our lives are stored in the phone  so as well as all the features  it would good to know which is more secure   is google really reading all your mail    which is easier to find  or lock down when lost     ultimately which is easier to replace with all your settings as it was    for me personally these are more important or the most helpful to have as well as all the other stuff  what’s the point have a mobile that you spend ages setting up or years customising as you want it if it gets lost in a day   it’s not easy to replace or secure 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the world of soul and creativity and flexibility and of course a lot of fun belongs to android  and the world of build qualities but made for soulless and hive mind is definitely belonging to ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the us apple but global android point to things like face time and the ecosystem seems to me reflective of the way americans like to be spoon fed their ideas and activities whereas the rest of the world is more wild chaotic but also adventurous and novel  its why ive never been able to get on the apple train  its just too restrictive even if it tells me ill be safe and satisfied by their standards  i peter my own standards and want to make my own mistakes  you have a much richer experience that way and learn a lot more   open source rules 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think gestures is also something to consider bc whenever i use someone’s iphone i just feel slower  like i would love a built in back button or quick actions to access apps or functions  but for me prob mostly the price
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one impressive thing too about this is that sure on paper apple might have won  but that’s impressive considering android is used across every other smart phone apart from apple and even though they’re all running android some will have more features than others
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive been with android since droid x though ive used a work issued iphone in the office until ive convinced them to give me an android  i also assist patients and staff with how to navigate their iphone android  iphone makes use really easy even though it can be somewhat limited but users dont really care if they dont know theyre missing it  at the same time  it gives them a really interesting misconception of how well they understand tech which becomes apparent when they need to troubleshoot something  but i guess thats what the genius bar is for  unless they come to me first
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,don’t watch  save your time and thank me later… both are winners in their own way  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung for life
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,excellent presentation   full of examples and arguments to support every topic   great work

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you should create a website for these categories and lets get some data with demographics included   ps  cool factor prestige is a big reason people get iphones
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i hate apple  very bad practices  honestly downright evil  android all the way  repairability  accessibility  freedom are the most important things  nothing else matters  im happy to see this world making small steps towards a good sustainable future  if it was for apple they would run us all down to the mines

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i like android for one reason and one reason only  you never have to buy an app
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when it comes to phone design  apple makes a lot of assumptions  and most of them are right 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,man if iphones added external storage and the headphone jack back  and usb c  id happily switch over without a second thought

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,your beutiful flip android phone can be hacked under  seconds  not so easy with ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios has airdrop and imessages  but the google pixel has infinite photo storage via google photos at standard resolution  ive been using the pixel for  years and iphones beforehand  somethings getting sacrificed either way 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lets be for real  samsung over everything
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,id gives apps to android   of the time  because you side load anything you want   product ecosystems are toxic and should be illegal  having a  stronger  ecosystem should be considered a negative  you should be able to buy a product from anyone and be able to use it to its full functionality with your other products

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,could we compare iphone vs android for accessibility 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the answer was in the heart of our wallets all along 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,theres so many aspects that can be relevant to some people or other  connectivity  availability  screen brightness  privacy settings  ip rating  b u d g e t  i think that the best thing for us as consumers is for these tech companies to keep competing against each other  from that perspective  you could say we are the actual winners 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i switch back and forth between android and ios  usually every   years  the folds got me this time around  loving the small form factor
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone focus can change your wallpaper
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one thing has to be price  can you buy an iphone for less than  bucks when the iphone  comes out  can you buy an android for less  some people clearly cant afford phones north of  us 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what is the mic you used to rec this video   previously you moved from dji mic wireless to lark max  so is there any purpose for that   lark max are great mics 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont know why no tech content creator ever talks about accessibility features when getting into  ease of use  ask anyone with hearing or sight disability they always use iphone because apple is actually so far ahead in that segment its not even close with android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i use both the ip  pro max and s ultra and i simply love both the phones  i usually use ip for social media etc and for work i use su  and i would keep on buying the new iterations of both the phones  cheers 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,build quality   i’d love android ported to iphone hardware   switched from samsung because of it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i feel like you shouldve went on about the connectivity of smart home devices as androids especially google flagships  have more of a smart home ecosystem than apple does  and same with siri  google assistant is so much more better  i enjoy my iphone but i miss certain features such as google assistant  i dont use siri as much as i did google assistant 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this video feels kind of redundant because the winner of each category was predictable and the final point about it being a personal decision and certain things mattering more to come people than others was also predictable
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,really enjoyed this  one modification i did to your rubric is that i give partial points to each platform  fraction that totals to   for each of the attributes  since as you said  the winner might be only be a small amount  or it could even be tied  i think this accounts for the fact that there are some areas where one platform wins by a lot  while in other areas  the difference is much less  the all or nothing scoring might make the difference between the platforms seem greater than it is  fwiw  after i did this partial scoring and my personal weighting  my results came up with   for android and   for ios   so close as to be negligible   and this actually maps to my personal experience  which is that i am really happy to use both 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have been switching between iphone and android for some years now  iphone    htc  which got stolen  then samsung  then back to iphone   then iphone  pro max  then one plus which sucks  somehow i keep coming back to iphone  the best android phone i had was the htc one m  the camera wasnt that good buy the android layout and build quality was great  i kept trying to fall in love with some other android phones but havent found one i truly find great
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is ahead of iphone is all categories

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,review fairphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,amazing video keep going brother
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’m a slave to ios  i use ipads for music production and have invested a lot in daw au plugins and sampling  i can use many of these apps on my phone for sketching ideas and airdroping them to my pad for future development  i’d love to give android a chance but not being able to use my apps is a no no 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the way you evaluated the ecosystem by drawing a comparison between apple and android  without mentioning the term  sideload custom apks  speaks volumes about how tech content creators on youtube can often guide viewers down a narrow path 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,yes competition is good 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,affordability and variety are what makes android a go to choice around the world
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the support is seriously underrated    after having several google pixels  and all of them having massive issues that google wouldn’t fix i went to the iphone   i can’t customize it as much but holy shit i’m blown away with how well it works without much thought   and if something does go wrong apple tends to sort it out really quickly  a friend had a speaker issue and it was fixed in under  minutes  that was kinda insane to me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love the stylus of my s ultra
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i had been using android  i got bored and switched to i̇phone years before  now i am missing some aspects of android  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,long term android user  ive been against switching to iphone for years  i considered myself a power user on an android phone  but  as time goes on  i find myself using less and less of the features and options that android gives and just using my phone as a basic phone for text call email  because of this  ive been contemplating switching to iphone and the fact that my wife and most of my friends are on iphone currently  although i havent made my decision yet  this video was very helpful and brought up some topics of each that i hadnt thought about  im going to continue to think about what phone ill get next and hopefully ill make the right decision for me  anyway  thank you for this video as i found it very helpful  take care 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios vs android  iphone vs pixel
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you and the crew should make a tool for determining what phone is best for you 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so when u say so many ppl want imessage and facetime u mean in usa right  thats roughly   of the world  lets add canada and uk  to it  wont cross more   common bro stop generalising the things thats important only for usa 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,focus mode really 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i disagree with ease of use on ios  theres no back button  gestures are inconsistent depending on what app you are using and it tends to try to automate certain features which can add inconsistency to someone that cant understand what is happening  android may function differently based on what phone you have but once you learn it for that phone its very consistent 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,outstanding   if fanboys and girls on either side get upset by this  they werent listening   you clearly show strengths and weakness for both and left it to the consumer to decide whats most important to them   i would add  status symbol   not important to me   i have an android phone at present  but im not a brand evangelist   but the iphone is the clear winner when it comes to a status symbol   which is strange now that a lot of samsung android phones cost more than the top of the line iphones   and the build quality is every bit as good   i can afford any phone i  want  i have a samsung s ultra because it is the best option for my needs available at any price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,since new iphones are on the way  all of the apple staff members are promoting the company on youtube like this video  there are others youtubers too whom you will soon see on youtube showing how great apple is  the fact is that apple is a lazy company and will not innovate this year either  nor will they do so with the iphone   however  this egoistic lazy firm  costing far more than what it provides to customers  may try to innovate this year  the amusing thing is when people will understand the value of their money    when they understand that apple solely produces phones for the us market and always puts the us ahead of all other nations  despite charging significantly more for their phones outside the us  the margin by which samsun defeats the iphone  will be intriguing to observe  as will whether apple offers any worthwhile upgrades this year 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so you basically used the category of ease of use to judge ecosystem  okay but anyway as usual in the end its always some diplomatic answer lol guess thats y u make the money
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im an android fanboy since the first android out there  recently also bought me a iphone  because why not  you cant compare those systems they have completely different focus  plus what does it matter some like this some like that  live and let live 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the only reason i use an iphone is to press  copy  on my phone and then  past  on my macbook or my ipad
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive had both android all day 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,customisability ios doesnt do it prettier  they just decide for you 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is the winner since ages 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, how it feels in the hand    no but for real  iphones lately have been painful to use  weight plus the sharp edges makes it not very nice to hold 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,once every few weeks i end up having to do some shit with files on iphone  i die that day 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thats the way it should be 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,really well done
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i am very curious on what developers you talk to when it comes to the apps discussion  im a software developer as well and would never dream of prioritizing ios development over android  apple is so stingy and infamously difficult to deal with when it comes to certifications and getting updates and new apps approved for their store  hell its even widely known that apple can just rip your app off their store whenever they want  just because they feel like it  it sounds like you only talk to the big tech devs like meta and google that have the notoriety and man power to push through apples ridiculous terms and conditions 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as i expected  starts with a comparison  then jizz about how good apple is  then the statement   there is no winner
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no os wide eq is a pretty major thing missing on ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,imagine how many years later people would be trying to understand how anyone could care about that topic 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i see windows vs mac behind you  looks like thats coming soon too 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the biggest problem with android is os and apps are still lag and freeze in   and samsung cant do anything good apart from phones  their tablets are horrible  their watches are horrible  i owned a lot of them in the past before i finally converted to ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i wish security was a category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one worst thing iphone in india is the apple pay  though apple has nfc in the disguise we cannot have the apple pay used in the indian market  but what is the issue in apple not allowing indian banks and their apps to use tap and pay featureni e  nfc
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think the ease of use should go to android otherwise agree to everything else you said  btw that point system was great thanks for that  as a tech enthusiast i always ask people what they want before suggesting anything to them and that is literally what you showed in your video we are the winners as long we have our needs and wants straight and sorted 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,imessage rules all   the one and only reason it will always be better 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,focus modes are available on samsung phones  so yeah android does have that feature  iphone till date lacks t dialing 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use  lets try transfering flac files to your iphone  using file manager  using dns  any adblocker  using an iphone for a lot of people feels like shooting themselves in the right knee 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i don’t need customisation i just need the phone to work  quickly and efficiently  iphone for me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marquees   i can make a video about this  please do 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, the real winner is us  they are competing against each other to try and win us over and thats the way it should be   loved it
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,cant help but notice how amazing the lighting is  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  android has focus mode 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i agree with pretty much everything you have said  i would have brought up a few other features on the iphone and a few ease of use things that android has as well  that imo would basically mean a tie in ease of use and in features categories  resulting in the same overall score anyway   but i just wanted to leave a comment about something coming to android  an app called bepper is getting closer to release and it allows full imessage on android  and it works very well  personally  i wish everyone in both camps would switch to signal simply because it is universal  has all the same features and allows video calls just like facetime  but as far as the  blue bubble green bubble  thing  you will be able to have imessage functionality and be a blue bubble with android   though you still have some caveats regarding facetime
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if andriod didnt exist apple would add zero new features to the iphone and charge you double the price
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video   just want to put that out there before my comment  i disagree on ease of use though  tried getting my mom some extra storage on icloud and it took me about  minutes for the whole setup  passwords  and everything else apple threw my way  android was one fingerprint scan and a plan choosing   literally a  second thing   now i understand what you mean with ease of use and icon placement or overhauling an entire app  but when i think about ease of use its more to do with complex stuff you have to do on your phone  rather than people not figuring out how to close a phone call because the icon has been moved a bit lower 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dont the beta versions give priority to android apps  i mean  i get the updates far ahead of ios since i am a beta user 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, the iphone doesnt come preloaded with bloatware   well thats just a lie 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,sorry but noone cares about any the things you mentioned in the video  try this airdrop  if your friends and laptop is apple  best selfies by far  negatives  cant even turn off whatsapp call notification  can lock fotos app with password face id    repair super expensive on iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,would be fair to mention that ios is a locked os which makes apps and updates little bit hard to compare among these two  software development is quite different for both platforms  there is no need to focus on different screen sizes on ios  anyway  i am android user  love to tweak my phone with different roms after the end of support which i cannot do on iphones  also repairability is important for me as i use to do everything myself 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,very good job in treating such a critical and  dangerous  theme  with great balance  but  marques  come on  the ecosystem just slightly for apple  its a giant difference and a two hour video wouldnt be enough to explain all the ecosystem features in apples technology  and what about security  not just updates  theres no game 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple rules
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,big percentage of users never care about facetime or imessage  its time when iphone users have to adapt interaction with android users
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the real answer is  who the hell cares  pick what makes you happy  its a phone  its not that serious 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,theres a price factor also contributes huge role
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about the storage management
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how can you miss the sideload feature of android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video  i rock with android  samsung s ultra  but i could never get a pc  i feel like having a mac allows me to do everything i need  but if i had an iphone  i would feel trapped  forced to depend on all of apple services  and bills  wouldnt want that  so i agree with the iphone winning   over android  objectively  but the apple ecosystem  prison  is precisely reason why i cant have an iphone for now 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,str bullshyt  no way should you have given the app feature to apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video  what a plot twist at the end  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,same boring content with no verdict at all  lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot a categories  iphone does not have a foldable  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i like the way you quantified it  but  equally as glad that you chose android  ha 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a video record pause button  for apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,maybe android give more choices
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android wins
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i agree mostly with what you said  however  just in general observation  i hear more people talk about the next iphone than i do hear people talking about the next android phone  so  i have to give excitement category to iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i feel bad for people that didnt watch till the end  because the kicker  final answer is exactly what you said in those last few frames how to pick your winner  and who the real winner is  great video  mb 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wish you had mentioned samsung dex  something apple will probably introduce in years
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, apple stores are everywher  good luck in eastern europe then where i live the nearest apple store is a whole city away customization  features  excitement  apps  updates  ease of use  ecosystem  support for old apps 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why didnt you give the point for ecosysteme to androide   androide is much richer  i cant control very simply my home and car with a iphone  you can connect android with samasung app to all your device even washmachine  unfortunately iphone is so close and late for many features
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the iphone may lack some features that android has but the features that iphone does have work better on the iphone than on android… sorry not sorry but i’ll always recommend ios over android  only if you’re a geek and really really need android for some stuff ios can’t do as easily but   of the population doesn’t fit in that category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you didnt mention the security of each os  android is a magnificently fragmented os  apparently this is better with samsung   has a lot of insecure apps available for  side load   and a ton more security issues than ios  as a tech guy  your preferences make sense  as youre more likely to know what youre doing  but for those of us who write software  often for people who shouldnt be near a computer which is the vast majority of all device users  i prefer  walled gardens 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the lighting  we need a bts on the studio channel of how you got this look 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,customization is not something i want  i was a linux user for years and it took me forever to get it how i wanted it   i switched to macos because i loved the curated choices they made for me and i grew to prefer it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,focus modes actually exist in android  atleast on one ui
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the background is soooo good   the studio never fails 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have been a mac and ipad user for quite some time now  but ive an android user throughout  im waiting for the iphone  pro max and am excited to get it  given that i wanted to switch  any advice on what changes in my life i might be looking at 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive decided to split  im keeping my sony xperia with a basic texting sim card for two factor authorization  the fingerprint scanner is safer security than face id and i have flexible space with a micro sd card and file manager  its a great screen for watching video  connects natively to my sony camera both with wifi sharing and as an external monitor  the sony xperia phones are awesome for content creators and professionals in multimedia  i also want the fingerprint scanner to help keep my crypto gapped from my new iphone im getting and the iphone will be for apple pay and cashapp  the reason im getting iphone is the ecosystem  not by my choice but my job has me on mac and i have an ipad thats hindered by not having an iphone  also i just constantly feel segregated via text for having green texts and imessage will work across everything i use daily  so im hoping it will make everyone else feel better when communicating with me  but im still in the features and flexibility camp so im keeping my sony for all the things it does that iphone doesnt especially the headphone jack because the built in dac drives my iems to musical perfection and im not one for apples mid quality music streaming  it feels like the best digital footprint separation i can do while still participating in the times  the iphone might ring off the hook all day with notifications  but my sony will only be used to talk to family and my partner so i can take a break from work    i also anticipate phones being replaced in the next couple years by fully featured wearables and ideally id like smart glasses for daily driving and a powerhouse phone for a networked mini computer    not to mention i dont want google or apple knowing everything about me so theyll have to piece things together between the two if they want all my data points 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,your evaluation score   method is flawed
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if iphone had usbc and a back button  i would seriously consider it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ridiculous contest  the iphone is not at all in the same league  it does not even compete with samsung a series  you know it but money makes you create a false contest there is no contest at all  be honest for once
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the  ease of use  category was made for iphone  yet my mom has a huge trouble adjusting to an iphone and finds it way too confusing than an android phone  also  iphone might be easy to use for english speakers but if you take a look abroad  its quite sh t for people who dont know english well 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,presenting the dinamic island as a feature is the biggest joke  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you realize that only the  yt reviewers are the only people using a phone in both ecosystems  right  youre either android or apple and whichever one  dont care about the other 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,very detailed video
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so  basically you can use whatever you want for android and mostly apples own or approved products for iphone  and that somehow leads to apple winning the ecosystem point  that makes no sense  freedom of choice is important to some people  after all 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  whatcha hiding on the screen back there 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hands down the best iphone vs android video out there and makes a ton of sense   side notewinking_face 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,security left the chat 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so  if you are out of us the winner is android  glad to did the right choice 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,completely disagree with ease of use  older non tech savvy people consider whichever they started with as being easier to use  maybe in the early days of smartphones  your statement stands  but not anymore  i know people who have been using galaxy smartphones and introducing them to an iphone is extremely confusing for them because using an android galaxy is so much easier for them to use  introducing an iphone or android to a kid for their first smartphone  i guarantee whichever one they stick with first will be  easier  to use  no matter what special ease of use features the phones provide 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i like the way you put it out on the point system and how people should judged on their needs  for me androids wins  ease of use  i find androids a lot easier  how can i customize my phone  android wins  ecosystem i dont care as i get other brand earbuds  watches  updates  i could care less  features are important  i juat wished android was more consistent and samsung more plain amd less double apps 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so funny that for the hyped for new iphone shot at   it looks like it has an action button
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,niagra for android makes my phone perfect 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,comparing all android phones with one and only iphone shows  how unique they are  unique stands seperate 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,whatever floats your boat
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,u can tell he wanted android to win so bad   but apple is unbeatable
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,sabe muito
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thanks for the great vid marques   i have the iphone but had the droid first phone   i miss it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when an apple fanboy creates a match up between iphone vs android  i think its pretty obvious who wins   i dont even need to watch this just to know that  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the image on the screen at the   mark  thats definitely niagara falls  american side  correct  specifically the beginning of horseshoe falls if im not mistaken 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a bit biased but thats understandable 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i bought my s ultra and i plan to use it for about  years  the way i used my note   happy android user  and im sure ill get the right updates and my phone will be as good as the st day  personally  optimization is key number  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my other factor is price  sorry for being poor  i use android  and hopefully one day to use both of them 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,someone please tell me why there is no clipboard in the iphone  it’s pissing me off    i use android and an iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you want a comprehensive test  you need to include the following categories as well   repairability cost value and flexibility  cheap phones  expensive phones  etc  cameras  these days  most people use their phone as their main camera  how about side loading apps  how about the fact that iphones dont work with several things outside the apple ecosystem  facetime and imessage 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the real winner is your taste 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so youre telling me    all the bling bling goes to android     and besides usbc   that is coming to iphones    all the important things are on iphones  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,cost  cost    i would say that   of people consider cost as a huge factor  and this is another interesting category  because the clear winner seems to be android since their cheaper  but apple phones retain their resale value incredibly well  i still give the w to android since there are flagships for    that frequently go on sale for   and you can buy good used android phones for incredibly cheap  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love the feel of the s  ultra   but i used an iphone and love imessage  but now with beeper im android full time again 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this episode is quietly sponsored by apple   free iphone  marques 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what are your thoughts on beeper and how it could help android and ios users communicate without the green bubbles
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you missed the category  peer pressure amongst children in the us   just kidding of course  great video and makes a lot of sense tbh 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is better for the elderly and women  its simple and elegant  android is more for men and techy persons
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android ftw   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the ultimate anti consumer company goes to apple and there are no other comparisons in the world 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,security  you are being watched 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i notice traveling over the last  years in eu and us  that its only yanks who insist on iphone  but change their tune overseas and start using whatsapp etc  i think yanks use iphone to keep people out but the rest of the world dont play the yank college clique games iphone means you are rich apparently in the us  here in oz the workplace  mates  family use iphone and samsung   i refer to myself as a samsung user not android  i can afford to buy iphone  in fact i bought all my daughters iphones but my son and my daughters bfs all only use samsung   i rock both a iphone  company phone and my samsung  ultra   but with all my mates  country and world wide we use whatsapp  fb messenger  telegram and signal 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in  easy to use  i would add that someone that comes from an android phone finds it hard that there is no  back  or  return  button  you have to use each native apps button to go back it is annoying  also as a software engineer is easier to develop for android than apple  the ways to solve problems on kotlin are way easier than swift  i am talking about component or implementing the ui that was develop  there are more restrictions on apple  you can ask any software engineer about this to confirm  also the apks and external ways to add applications on android is a plus  i think why some of this applications have more support from apple is because of they are already apple users  like everyone in the usa  or there is money in the back because as a software engineer i would pick to develop on kotlin everyday instead of swift 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great work  agreed w almost everything except focus mode  lol  different android companies have had this kind of feature for like  years  i don’t know why people are so excited about and that’s one thing that android users  do we laugh at apple users cause they get a new feature that we’ve had for years and years and they think it’s gold  lol  i have a pro max  and i’ve had better alarm management systems and do not disturb systems then i have now 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,regarding apps  i have a different opinion  why  simply because apple limits very much what developers are allowed to do  look at firefox browser being forced to use apples rendering engine  swiftkey not being allowed to add a th row with numbers to their keyboard or how apple forces developers to process all in app purchases through apple only  sorry  but for me  the app category goes to android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,gonna have to disagree on the app portion  unless iphone has suddenly allowed side loading apps not in the appstore  if i cant use youtube revanced  i aint buying it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,avoiding privacy  is bunker   but typical youtube
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i agree with most points and arguments for each case but i definitly agree with the result  as someone whos used both android and iphone for + years  i picked up the iphone to comment this because the apps are nicer  watching on tv 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i will never forget the day i got my beats solo pro headphones  my iphone immediately recognized it and and connected in like  seconds 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,three most sensitive topics to talk aboutface_with_tears_of_joy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,real winner is the customer because theres literally an option for everyone  i just wish that people used that to their advantage instead of trying to force their preference on everyone else through some law or government regulation 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this isnt even a debate  android is a clear winner
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone user give iphone the win what a surprise
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,use xiamoi for android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how about this category  security 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use was really stupid
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,boooooo apple   had a new iphone  pro max for three months now  previously motorola and pixel owner  not happy  disappointed in where technology is at  apple is complicated to use and after you master the ui it’s not anything special  the greatest disappointment though  are the apps  i was under the impression that i phone apps were higher quality and that there would be more of them  i was very  very wrong 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is just an overrated  over priced hand phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,very good explanation
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,still happy with my  xiaomi mi a 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the z flip is really cool  and i would love to have usb c  but i like the iphone because apps are updated more often and thinks like gopro pair better 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,deep down mkbhd knows that android kills iphone  but  he does not want to offend the apple cult and lose on his audience 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love the iphone… all i want though is to be able to move the icons wherever i want  that’s it  i don’t even care if i can’t really change the look of the icon with icon packs  just let us move them wherever… then end 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love the fact that technology has grown so much that we all have so many choices  and what you love you can get  but what matters to me the most is the ecosystem and the apps  and ease of use  because of what i do  apple‘s apps work for my life better   i don’t care anything about customization because my phone has looked the same from iphone to iphone for about seven years straight but i do see very exciting  android phones that i would just love to play with and they seem like a lot of fun  i would never say one is completely better then the other
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i agree with basically everything but id have to give the slight win to android for sideloading apps  not for free apks but for smaller devs or compatibility on older phones
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in cost of what you have paid for       android is cheaper and accessible   which connects a huge user community  apple is selfish yeah may be best in quality  android is messiah for all class to experience the smartphone world
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot one category  the  ball and chain   i would rather have a device that plays well with others than be locked in an ecosystem for life 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think just for the fact that i can install any apk with such ease makes me pick android   having everything ad less is too good
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive had both and i prefer android  i still keep my icloud account tho 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is the best  period 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is the best video i so nice
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,funny you mentioned car because i switched to iphone cuz bmw m cs  doesnt support android auto   i think for apps it should have been a tie  because with androids most apps dont require weekly monthly subscriptions  a good example is global eq apps and ringtones  when i switched to iphone i was shocked how hard it was to have a custom ringtone and how all the eq apps wanted to charge a subscription   but ecosystem i agree  apples experience across devices and airplay is incredible  android can have janky experiences even with samsungs ecosystem 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i started with blackberry as smartfood  then iphone    and then  i swiched to samsung  till  and now back to iphone  android is awesome  but somehow i prefer iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,maybe we can evolve enough some day in which a decision will only be about the aesthetic and customization of the exterior of the device  doubt it tho 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android   because they both suck but android sucks less
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, mkbhd repairbility and durability is also a factor to be considered and also androids do have focus mode i have been seeing it on android phones ive come across
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i care about having a back button and not about hunting the ui to go the previous screen 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,price is the most important factor  when the sprint switched to t mobile  my phone was no longer compatible they gave me a year to replace my lg phone   what i refuse  finally they sent me a galaxy s for free  and it is an amazing phone   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"android  hey jimmy  now that youre five years old  its time you learnt to pull your weight around here  here are the keys to my gtr  go nuts  but try not to crash  well  good luck   apple   enters  hey jimmy  what are you doing  how many times have i told you to stay away from my gtr  give me those keys right now   jimmy  but dad  android said i could drive it   android  yeah  i did  and im not backing down  jimmy is old enough to learn how to drive  and im going to teach him   apple  but hes just a kid  he could get hurt   android  hes not going to get hurt  ill be right there with him   apple  fine  but if anything happens to him  youre going to regret it   android  i wont regret a thing  this is about jimmy learning to be independent and responsible  and im going to make sure he does    android and jimmy get into the gtr and drive away  apple shakes his head in disapproval   android is the cool dad who wants his son to learn how to drive  while apple is the protective dad whos worried about his son getting hurt "
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,conclusion  everything is amazing and nobody is happy  everything is amazing and nobody is happy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the nd point i would have picked ios  those tiny settings android have imo is better when your phone just behaves well that you can forget about that  less is more   i have both systems and i just love that the iphones seems to just be there for you  work for you and no the other way around  i think those are settings that most of the people wont need to use and theyre just there as an introduced problem that you have to tweak to enhance your experience  totally unnecessary 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use and you dont mention the back button on android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i actually really appreciate this video  and i’d highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a new cellphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the  apps  category is a straight up win for android in india  many of the govt apps are only available on the play store  and the ones available on the apple store  are just not good 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple ecosystem always loses to linux  my android phone syncs its data to my server  which can be accessed everywhere  this works best for me  but some technical know how is needed to run this setup  open software is better because it can be made to work with other things
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in the ecosystem part  the phenomena of  green bubble bullying  has to be mentioned  where a subset of us iphone sales come from a perspective of buying an iphone because without it youll be ostracized or bullied because of how imessage treats non iphones in both individual and group chats  as well as the  perceived poverty  of a green bubble  abroad this isnt much of an issue  as apps like whatsapp or line act as a cross platform messenger with equal features no matter your device 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when you compare a mustang to a bike 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,both are great  but the reasons mk listed is why i always go with iphone lately  i really enjoy the customer service that comes with iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,can you do an episode for huawei mate  pro  seems like its one hot product recently 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ايه الجديد
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you are comparing iphone vs android the ecosystem should go automatically to iphone because even if samsung has an ecosystem it does not belong to android  killing the ability to chose android from different manufacturers 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,using one cable for all of your stuff is bs  because sometimes your need to charge stuff at the same time
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is better for me  because i have more variety of models to adapt to my specific needs  but i think that for most the simplest and best option at the same time is iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  i bigger to differ i have focus mode on my oneplus  i think its difficult to compare both operating systems when theres just  one  ios but many android builds
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is m ore secure  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,customization is all i care about and android will always win in that category
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great content  i enjoy both phones and agree with this list  can you do ipad and samsung tablet  i have iphone mainly for ecosystem
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android can have headphone jack  and android has an actually usable file system  have photos in a usb flash drive  no problem 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple will always be trash as long as they charge +  markup for the same hardware  superglue in components to prevent repair  and fight tooth an nail to stifle creativity  repair  and convenience  like proprietary plugs  monopolistic practices  and extremely punitive app store requirements 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,isn´t  price  important 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,looking at customization i just shed a lil tear for windows mobile  the only phone os where i intentionally kept a screenshot of the home screen because it was legit beautiful 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as a iphone user  iphone misses  giant important feature  so basic  its embarrassing its not there  separate volume control 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,customization can be a mixed bag   if you are doing tech support over the phone and cant see the other phone ive had a better faster luck with ios as most everything is the same between models  in the past with android different oems could be wildly different even before  the end user starts changing things drastically   not sure how it is now on android though 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i bought an iphone  years ago   its too limiiting and controlling  only thing i like is seamless face id  rest of the benefits of iphone doesnt suit me  as  i do not own any apple product  it just isnt for me  actually  i am bored of this phone completly  will be switching to s this year 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,winner in north america  but row i doubt ios will be a winner 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,google pixel software ecosystem should not have been dismissed  gmail  maps  chrome  photos  drive  notes  youtube  and their compatibility with literary any smartphone  except huawei 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i use both so i have best of both worlds 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,youtube has revenced  its not only about blocking ads but the app itself is so good  the customization is unmatched  i can make the app like my own liking without doing the code
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why was security not included  i have used iphones since  over android because of the this  just look at aot vs  jit compilation  android can run dynamic code  very dangerous  iphone cant 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,good video  android for me ive used both and android has always had more of what i want  ive always been a huge techy and simply want to experience the very latest  i like that sony  samsung  and asus  always pushed things too the edge and try experimental risky new things that turn into trends later  apple is too basic and nonexciting for me or anyone who truly loves new technology and the latest tech  ive had the z fold since the z fold   got the  when it first came out and just got the fold   been with sony from since their ericson phones up until the samsung  edge came out then i was team samsung and into their entire eco system ever since then 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this guys comparisons are so funny  hell go from something comparable to something like between mcdonalds and burgers king   apple being burgerking  burgerking has the best double whopper lmao what a joke 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,good framework for assessing these platforms on a personal basis  this same framework could work for windows vs mac  customization of windows is far greater than mac but that comes with a price in terms of complexity and support 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what is  mkbhd hiding from us at grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,prediction at  seconds    android on top    customization  android features  android ease of use  iphone updates support  iphone apps  android excitement  android ecosystem  iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps part obviously goes to android lol  not only because of the number of apps in their stores but also the ability to download apps from another platforms 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps has to go to android tho  side loading is just too op
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung ecosystem is limited to android and windows on their external devices  the phones and tablets run android  while the laptop runs chromium or windows which are entirely different systems thus they cant integrate that well  they have buds and watch which is the basic step of an ecosystem and all the external devices use wi fi and are connected to external application  apple has the best ecosystem and it is normal as they create all the software and hardware for their devices  android in the face of samsung is catching up  but will never be the same 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use  cant plug an iphone into a conputer to get photos off it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple wins in resale value to apple fans on launch day 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in my place of work they have some group chats on imessage which i find quite irritating  and i’m an iphone user myself  just use whatsapp  i feel like that does put me off of android when it really shouldn’t  i’ve been with apple since  and i’m starting to feel like moving over to android for a change
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,keep it real all they care about is if your bubbles are blue 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i used to use samsung and then got a sick friend whom i took care of and she used apple and i and her dad  also samsung user  wouldn’t get texts for several hours sometimes which wasn’t a good thing  i switched over to a s+ iphone when the  was top  i now have an xr  bought when the  was top  i am now in the apple vortex  as are a lot of people with whom i associate 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this guy is just an iphone salesman  figures 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android has focus mode
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,expectations the next arc is gonna be lit 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone cool 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,youve had money for too long if you think apple has good customer service
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,coming from an apple ecosystem fanboy  you couldnt have been more random with those categories  and some reasoning is clearly targeted towards the iphone  why having fewer apps is better  why having more walls around the ecosystem is better  and finally  usb c repairability  sustainability  are two significant factors in the comparison and theyre barely glanced over   love your content but this video is a bit clickbait y  p
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,by the customization security apps etc apple won
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im a simple guy  if i cant afford it  i wont buy it  with this logic  android is the best 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,during the  apps  section you missed the pretty big fact that on android you can sideload apps  install apks and use many foss app stores alternatives to the play store  there are tons of simply great foss apps that are otheriwse unavailable on both play store and apple store  its sad that we got to a point where the public only cares about  where does instagram look better  when talking about apps 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,excelent vídeo  agreed of everything 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you should add a category for vfm
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thats a fair take on this debate
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have now used an iphone for a year after a long lineup of pixels  admittedly i switched because of some issues with my pixel   but  it was a major mistake  this iphone has issues too  bugs and all  it feels dumb and slow compared to my previous phones  it is seriously limiting and the constant barrage from free apps that want you to buy their paid versions is simply disgusting  not to mention the abysmal notification system  will be switching back to a pixel at my first opportunity 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well done  one category that is rarely mentioned is repair speed  i have so many times taken a cracked screen to a local apple store and been back out the door with a perfect phone in hours  so for me  the   punch of apple care plus a large network do apple stores is incredibly valuable  i’ve never understood the equivalent for android devices  samsung has a few  but nothing close 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im a leftie  i need to be able to arrange icons in the left bottom corner  android has been a no brainer based on that alone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about cost 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nah bro  you literally explained that last category extremely well  and then gave the check mark to the wrong category  cmon man
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so you woke up and decided to make a debate friendly obviously money making easy video  great job  maybe you get newer subscribers with these sort of videos  ahh the difference in video quality is mind blowing  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hey  there are some statement which we cannot agree     there no apple store everywhere  may be in us and some country you find  but not all countries where the apple phones have been selling     regarding the update promises  yeah we do agree with android like some not up to the promises  when it comes to iphone  all the older phones are not receiving all the features  there would be only   features only pushed to the older iphones as os upgrades  where as in android you cannot see that  if the company promises for an os upgrade they have to work on all the features of android numbers and yes they push   of os upgrades to the phones till the count the brand promises like samsung  pixel and etc   that might be the reason the android phone companies are not promising for long term updates  but here comes the samsung and pixel devices with   years of os upgrades and   years of security updates  years update with fairphone     
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use is such a fake category   people have ton of question about how to use iphone  there always had to be someone  who explains weird iphone routine and finishes it with the  that is how obvious it is 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for some of the apps you have to pay money in ios store where as in android you dont have to pay in play store  for me personally  i dont care about the updates delayed a day or   or a week where i dont have to pay money unnecessarily   so considering the list of items from the video android always wins for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if im going to do a real comparison of the two i would do perfomance speed durability screen longevity battery camera
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the biggest category mkbhd always misses out is price  with apple youre always forced to buy a relatively or very expensive device for everything in their ecosystem  with android you can get thousands of dollars flagship tech  or dozens of dollars ultra budget options and everything in between 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung does have an focus mode alternative called the bixby routines and as a primarily ios user i can vouch that its more versatile and more robust but also more buggy
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love how he makes his videos so interesting and fun to watch  whenever he makes a video  it feels like its a one on one thing  like the way  he expresses himself and just acts so natural  in my honest opinion  his videos are the most interesting to watch  and im sure even none tech lovers would love to watch them 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,didnt talk about price value at all   when its ignored companies will increase prices until it affects sales or is always talked about as a con 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,he gave  apps  to iphone what a joke of the century   you must be a 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use should go to android   give a phone to an old person who has never used a smartphone and see  because android is so customizable  it can be made to be extremely simple  im pretty sure some androids have a simple mode in settings  makes buttons and fonts and icons huge  iphone cant even change gesture navigation
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, its iphone for you always why pretend bro i have just brought a laptop and phone but both of them are android and windows because if its ecosystem i can make my own and in iphone cant even increase the storage or a ram what is the use of it
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’ve been an iphone user since right at the start    my biggest missing feature which they still haven’t addressed is a simple back  undo button 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, ios vs android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would give the apps category to android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,awesome content dear  terrific video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the thing i hate about apple is  the way they separate each device into its own  world  per say    example  m m ipad is the new computer you can buy the keyboard and mouse  can you actually use it in terms of downloading programs and moving files and such  or perhaps for developers you can atleast download a text editor and or virtualisation since its the new computer right  no buy a macbook for that  but id like to take my notes and stuff on one device only  tough luck  this way the ipad is just a glorified notepad thats alright to watch netflix on or something  wake up 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wait a tick  if android is the most customisable  it makes sense that that would be easier to use  once set up  because you can optimise it to how you find it most easy to use a device  i think youre measuring continuity between devices  not ease of use   while were at it  personally  i find walled gardens such a turn off  instead of being able to mix and match to get the best set of devices for you  you have to either go all in  which doesnt work for everyone  eg mac os doesnt run some of the programs i use daily  or not at all 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for ecosystem  why are you comparing samsung to apple  isnt this about android vs apple  for me android ecosystem is about interoperability between android devices  its not about interoperability within a brand that happens to also manufacture android devices 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as an iphone user  i will pull for android   this means that apple has to pick up their game   this goes the oither way to   competition benefits us all   im still using an    i like tech but i like my bank account more 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in summary your preffered is the best for you  cheers  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have s ultra and iphone  pro iphone  pro sucks to be honest  iphone has no samsung dex  no apple pay in korea  only hyundai  cannot easily transfer files to pc  cannot customize even the keyboard size  no built in s pen  but its just me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  you cant even sync apple watch to an ipad  really  apple    cellular ipad means data only  not for calling  for android g lte tabs  its just like a phone with a huge screen     usb c is the best thing ever  been on android for ages 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,forgot to mention that with android you have better prices  you want something cheap  mid or expensive  android  apple is expensive to more expensive 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about data security aspect  could you please explain the pros and contras in both softwares  maybe in another vid 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use    lol  steps on android and  steps on ios  i got both  i know that 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what if the real winners are the friends we made along the way
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is the winner here 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps point goes to android  there are many apps which are not even available for ios where in case of android there are so many apps  also the beta test always comes first on ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone every single time
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a huge factor not covered is lack of variety on pricing  apple will in every category demand high pricing  infact to use the apple eco system you will fork out much higher price  and there arent any other options too  its a monopoly basically 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,unfortunately  there is no substitute for experience with a device and it’s software system  and  it takes time and effort to get tech where you want it  despite having tried a flip android based phone  i am staying with apple devices  blended with google workspace offerings  i even mix in a little outbox  as microsoft has designed some beautiful apps for ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love your videos  watch just about all of them  however i think you should add longevity and resale value also to that list  ive had multiple samsung flag ships  including the fold and ive had two pixels and at the end of the day about one year in both android device significantly slowed down  they werent loading content properly  apps start crashing and my battery was dead by pm esp on the pixel phones  then you have the looming issue of paying  + for a android for it to lose  to   of its vaule in the first year in insane  phones arent cheap disposable devices anymore like they were in  so reasle and longevity need to be on this list 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about security 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a thing that comes up a lot from people who swear by the iphone is how important imessage is  and that texting someone with an android is annoying because you only get the default sms  but android devices has the rcs rich communication services  system  which is basically the same thing as imessage  apple just wont let you communicate as easily with android phones  because they dont want their devices to work well with stuff that isnt apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,spoiler  nothing is better
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me is it and will be always iphone  ive switched a couple of times  but i always go back to ios  the simplicity  the eco system  updates  apple pay  security it is just better  for me  with android im always looking for the right setup  the right feel and it is always sluggish  there is only  android phone that i can name that made me happy and that was the samsung s  after that it never happened again 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,after  years  still i cant see history in ios calculator 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use  crazy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wow  i knew google was the winner
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would have to slightly disagree with this part    no bloatware in iphone  arent all system apps bloatware  i know a lot of people who use chrome and gmail on the iphone  so for them safari seems bloatware  just nick picking a little 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,poor man rich man   its  not always about practicality  its about style and personality haha  what about poco   with high end processor and features money saving winner for sure 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im surprised focus mode is only available on ios now  ive had that feature for four years now on my budget android phones  i can choose what apps to  silence  and then set a timer or toggle the focus mode on off from the notifications shade as needed  very useful for studying or lectures 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no one care about the apple ecosystem other than americans 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,here in india  people do not know one thing about ecosystem  customization and many do not even know everything about iphone and android features  but they just buy iphone because it has an apple logo on it  apple has made this kind of brand value  yes  the iphones are good and has amazing camera but i always prefer samsung because it has the best and cleanest ui  amazing camera cant beat iphone in videography yet but in photography samsung is the absolute beast  and samsung has the most amazing customization features 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,cant we all just be friends
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thanks 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,most android owners want an iphone  but most iphone owners dont want an android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i agree with all your points but for us like
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,please change the title to add  in the us  many of the points are not true at all if you are outside the us
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,pro tip  get both a premium iphone and a midrange android and youre good to go 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,where is rapairability  isnt that an improtant factor when selecting a phone anymore 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if i even leave apple am getting the sony phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,most people choose iphone beccause of the ecosystem 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone still doesnt support split screen mode and just implemented widgets recently while android has been using it since its early years  also there are lots of android phone that can full charge in just  mins and it makes me laugh at iphone users calling themselves superior
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,without even watching this android wins  next competiton please 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,fairphone has  years of updates
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,outside the us  especially in africa  ecosystems font matter  but when we struggle to meet up  android makes it easier 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a phone is an extension of ourselves  and the idea that one platform is objectively better for everyone is simply an impossible dream  i personally love android  and i have my reasons  but my friend loves his iphone  and he has his reasons   he doesnt have to argue why  and neither do i  its simply a matter of personal taste  preferences  priorities  and tech style among others  the same thing goes with xbox and playstation 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,interestingly enough  i only care my android has the first two that android one 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hey marques  you forgot about automatization options in ios can you do that in android  can samsung or google can notify you that your phone has been charged up to   just asking i really do not know
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what’s the different between focus mode on apple devices and do not disturb on android devices  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it seemed kind of odd to me to just view at samsung when talking about the android ecosystem  while there is the growing pixel ecosystem and microsoft generally supporting android over ios with stuff like phone link    nevertheless  the win obviously has to go to apple  so i agree with your conclusion but not your arguments 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, too first world review it seems  who am i to complain though 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,really had to stretch to make apple win those categories it won  its   in favor of the android  objectively so 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is like gaming console and android is like pc
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video   thanks   could you do a comparison between the google and apple wallet  would love to see that   thanks
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont see what all the hub bub is about  the best phone ever made  was made in  and it was an android phone  the moto z  not the z and its punch holed screen and unresponsive underscreen fingerprint reader 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how can camera not be a category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the real winner is the friends we made along the way
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,support and update how about using custom rom to get latest security updates on android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its hard to say and choose  side these days but its hard to migrate from  os to another because than you have to buy all new devices to keep personal ecosystem working
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i completely disagree about apps  i couldnt care less if i get the latest version of instagram  weeks later than an apple user  android allows apps to have a lower level of control over the system  allowing a wider variety of apps to exist so you can do more with your phone  for example  last month i was in a hotel room wanting to watch netflix on the  non smart  tv in the room and all i had was my phone and a usb a charging cable  no problem i just grabbed an app that allowed streaming media over usb to the usb port in the tv  good luck doing that on an iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,arguing which phone is the real winner is like arguing with other people about how much you love your wife and telling the other guy his wife a terrible  each person have their own  personality
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,broke boys rock androids
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone  will have type c
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,note pen enough said
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this video is well made to the end  you are the one who made me a fan of one plus in  and you are one who will make me a fan of pixel very soon  as an apple user since   i believe the iphone and android both are great in their own way now  thank you for this video  marques <
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its  and we are still discussing this cliché 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would say i was surprised that the apps went for ios as my main reason on android is apk  and that it is possible to release apps that dont need the approval process  emulation and ad removal would not be possible in the same way on iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one of the biggest features android had kept me with is the clipboard  copy multiple items and theyre still there
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios has a lifestyle advantage  if you have an iphone  you show  style  and  wealth   i think its also shows your lack of imagination as you have what everyone else has  but hey  you do you  also  get a rd party messaging app  my god  green vs  blue bubbles is the downfall of society if thats your biggest problem  idiocracy calling 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’ve used a lot of androids and iphones  in my personal experience iphones are a lot more reliable  i also believe they tend to have great battery life because of how they are optimized  they can be kind of boring at times but the slogan goes  it just works  currently on the iphone  pro  this thing is still a champ  works just like the day i got it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,based on these headlines you picked  you werent baise at all  explanation well done
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,having gone from iphone to pixel  i can say that google has blown apple away in the  ease of use  category especially if you are a gmail user  or on a google domain  suite 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i kinda disagree with the apps of a thing going to iphone  infact to the reverse is the case as many people are staying on android because of the limitless number of apps  as you said there are rare gems in the playstore  think of it this way  if the rare gems are  in  apps  you can calculate the number of gems available to android since it has  billion more apps than apple store 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i cant see  taps to turn some settings on off being easier to use than  on android  overall  ease of use is definitely android  everything else is comparable but audio lag still much better on iphones but so many other things are better on android so it should be the winner overall
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is much better in my experience  android performance degrades quickly 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hey guys  i want to know whats the fold phone in   is it from oppo

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as someone that has used both android and iphones ill take ease of use and ecosystem everytime  give me a phone that has smooth transitions and just works reliably everytime  boom  ill never forgive google htc for their shitty updates that made using their phone a nightmare and slowed it down to the point it was an expensive paperweight  plus samsung galaxy and how slow those processors were trying to open apps  no ty  i think androids are fine fyi but i just dont need to spend countless hrs wasted to customize every part of my phone  plus apple support is an important factor  good vid mr  brownlee 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android steals dayta from your life and full top tier social media apps owned by same company installed on your phone   no privacy    iphone useless if no nobody uses the same brand has your phone and refuse open source   technically or no is not opens source anymore android ~>   why android is much integration between the company google to the android apps they have even the developer cannot refuse  what google   trash    says    theres no competition why people asking always integration between companies also no open source scince linux just launch 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great vid marques

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well said  if you have added value for money and affordable  mostly the android would win  then it is  winner points for each  im writing this using oneplus  pro and owning iphone  pro as well  mainly i use android and like it more for the features  battery  camera and flexibility  enjoy everyone your smartphone  either ios or android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone has this  super underrated feature where i can give access to only a select few images videos from my entire phone library  and each time i feel like uploading any picture or  video to any other app such as insta  tiktok  or any random app  iphone will act as a super wall and the requesting app will be given permission to only that specific image video  this by far is the most underrated feature on an ios ecosystem   when i do this in instagram  i can see instagram crying missing a puzzle in understanding me by reading all my images videos from my gallery  which it wants to have access unnecessarily by default setting  the same is with most apps  they just want access to all my pictures videos  but but iphone tot he rescue  it keeps build privacy wall with granular controls  super love this feature 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  theres a one most important factor    price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,k for a phone is crazy
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use number  priority cause i just like it to work amd not scratch my head thinking about it
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,excitement should go apple as well  even if the upgrades are shit  let’s be real  people are still more excited for the launch of iphones over androids  hence  why iphone sales are better than everyone else  you should also add status  apple screams one level better than android products  also  resell value  android resell is ass  why buy androids brand new lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,where is the category  value for money  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,security and privacy  uh 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,medium price android phones are pretty good these days  i am not buying anything over  usd ever 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have to disagree with apps  android apps are more powerful  for example  i played untraslated japanese game and i can use screen translator app on android  i say both android and apple apps both have their own advantages and disadvantages  so i give it a draw 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,updates lots of apps will never run on ios such as wifi scanners  call recorders  browsers  ios  apps are jumbo enormous to fit every idevice and android apps are dynamic  ios apps are more reliable  privacy apple hardware is better  but youll pay for it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,was an iphone user since the iphone until xs  i had  ipads   macbook air   macbook pro   never again buying or using apple products 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,categories  privacy  and  security  are very important to pick a winner 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,indian apps are not available in ios like jio fiber cable wifi app some others to
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how is it that theres an excitement factor but not a repairability factor 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as a user of both platforms  you totally missed out dual sim  travel support and price  also  you forgot to tell that ios updates slow phones every major update  furthermore  the usa is not the entire world  prices are a shame in some countries  if youre analyzing by country  worlds biggest market is china  and in that country  android is more than three times bigger than ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have both ios and android both have pros and cons
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, they are improving to win us   thats what we always like to hear as a user  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i cant help but say that the way you generalize the summary of how we may distribute the points is so general yet very true  then again  the points system changes every now and then depending our needs  so it is how it is 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in my experience  customer service from apple is atrocious  the closest apple store is a  hour drive over km away and they have policies that can brick a device   even when you are the owner of the device  they prohibit me from repairing my device or even installing apps on it without using their app store  then they  end support  when also blocks access to the app store  then after all that  they tell you to buy a new iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,love that marques uses pocketcasts  little love for the best podcast player out there 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i feel like apple users like being restricted to what they can customise  and they dont know any different

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i disagree with you on apps 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in this battle  there will be no clear winner ever 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i knew who was going to win even before watching this video  because this video came into this channel   how brilliantly people ignore so many simple things you cant do in an iphone    can you share a link   just download work mode in iphone then boom half of these features are not available to you anymore 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,guy is left with no topic to discuss 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,good video  a couple of issues that probably only concern those in the uk and maybe europe is the ruling recently on having the ability to change your battery yourself because a new ruling he been approved for this option to return  i know can find who where what when about this need to know more  second is the ability on the transfer of k and k files is problematic in ability to quickly move these files and the varying ability to do this thats why the sd card was so important  you swap a full sd card faster than transferring these files with wich ever option is the best to do this and its still  limited an as fast as they are still cant compete with the seconds it takes to remove this card that many still have as a choice   the third  issue is the space which is being addressed by only offering the new gb option no gb standard is pointless with all the updates with the apps using the space up most of us regular people use their phones to fly to the moon if they could   the forth issue is speed is awesome on one level but the internet as a whole has issues  of to many bottlenecks of videos not playing in an article to commercials that are just plain about the awesome game only to find its a bait and switch  the game is obvious different from the advertised one  thats an everbody issue  the fifth is the ability to quickly stream is also an issue  the companies want you to stream but it get more expensive to do so especialy to those that have a monthly plan that cant afford an unlimited amount plan of content  they use it up because they are unable to correctly verify how much is data will be used up  it is not truly clear just basis issues and you can find out more than i can hint hint again good video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,fantastic video and very very spot on i clearly find for my needs being my phone is used for business  file management  and also have a lot that runs off my phone and controlled by my phone that android has always been my clear winner i feel like apple is very geared towards teens as most kinds cant live without apple i find android works more flawless in my life and think if more apple people where open minded and tried android they would jump out of the apple cult i know a few who have and wish they did so sooner love the fold  and came over from s ultra 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is what we need to 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,repairability  affordability  and ability to download apps from different places
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how many of you are going to pay   to   for usb type c iphone s 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,seems like youtubers using this topic even before the android and iphones existed  still im here looking for any new differences like they know any more than me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it will always boil down to the user preferences   either from a budget perspective or social status or features    good video though 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love apple cause of their simplicity and user friendliness  don’t have to do a million things to your phone  it’s a phone and it does what it should especially if it’s an iphone  i just bought the  pro max from s was iphone for years but iphone broke got a good deal on s i loved that phone but then i realized all the extra crap i didn’t need  so glad to be back with iphone  and gonna stay with from here on out 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i don’t understand why people feel the need to debate preferences  it makes zero sense  all we’re doing is dividing ourselves from each other  use what works best for you  not what works best for others 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont know about general phones but my samsung has had  focus mode  for the longest time now 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in the app section you didnt take into account what some apps let you do on android that would be impossible on iphone  from emulators to customization to sideloading apps  this point is close just because devs are usually cleaner on iphone  but i would give it to android just for the infinite app possibilities 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i knew that this would be apple bias  i dont agree with you on the updates and support  android just ticks all the boxes 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps category is bs  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great take  i’m a boring no nonsense old guy who couldn’t care less about customization and excitement  my job is complicated enough that i’m not interested in complicated gadgets  ease of use  updates support  and ecosystem take the top spots  so i carry an iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you should do an update video on the pixel  pro  debating if i should get the  pro or switch to the iphone  pro max
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great system marques  this is the most fair comparison ive seen  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the biggest plus point for me in ios is long software support and no bloatware  however android is clear winner as far as customisation and new features  tell me who does not want his phone charged  percent in  odd minutes when you are in hurry 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there are lakh of iphone cases available in market as compared to android so customization is more in iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,incredibly well summarized  especially the ending   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  you literally missed the most important factor here which is flexing  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple>>>bug android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there are dependent stuffs too right  like customization and ease of use  i would say a customized setup gives better satisfaction improving ease of use 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,can you do an apple vs android ecosystem video  i know ive seen vids like mike obriens but id like to know your thoughts  ecosystems are definetely one of the deciding factors nowadays and i never would have considered it  years ago 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,anh làm chủ đề này nhức đầu nha
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,did i just watched the whole video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my guy lowkey just ended the war between mobile tech fans
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i would always use android as my primary device and an iphone for business 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how is cost not one of the categories  it doesn’t matter how good the features are if you can’t afford it   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the real winner is the consumer  competition is good and pushes companies to come out with the best phone each year 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont care i use both  adroid for gaming iphone for work purposes
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i believe that side loading and customization are only important for maybe   of customers  i think some engage and after a while  the thrill is gone  ease of use and simplicity ends up being the greatest day to day factor over time for the vast majority of customers and that’s who apple targets   i can also see how apple’s ecosystem and the need to protect things  itunes music purchases  applepay setups and faceid  causes conflicts  creating easy open file systems exposes the iphone to more attack vectors  risking the phone’s security  so a weighted decision is made to compromise accessibility in the name of security and ease of use  this is not a bad compromise for   of phone buyers  as many are not techies  i’m a techie and i use both oses  and while i can appreciate the flexibility that android provides  the truth is that on a day to day basis  those advantages have little impact on how i most often use my phone  for that reason  i prefer to use my iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well  the apple keynote is near so obviously… 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no need to make a video  the answer is always android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro forgot about apks and actual files you can use so just because there is all these apps on the google play store there is still millions more you can download
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the greatest android feature is the universal back button
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me at least  i will never buy an iphone or ipad because they are too dang expensive  i can get an android tablet or phone thats just as good for a fraction of the price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i wont bother watching cause i know the answer is  both are good in some ways  so nothing new to expect 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you cant compare them  apple sells the equivalent of domestic appliances  since they just work and you cant do anything else to them  and android sells computers that you can customize almost every bit of it  even the type of users are different 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think you missed googles ecosystem in general and how easy it is to use
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great content again for everyone who uses a mobile   marques can you donate one cellphone to my daughter she is eight years old  she needs it for school   hope you can help a fan here in the philippines 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is the king of smartphone options 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one more category could be status symbol  apple has become a status symbol for many  holding apple means you are rich superior  which is the general feeling 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung got dex  game over apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hmm  so i ran through formula for myself  i have used the latest from samsung  iphone   save the pro models   and pixel  the answer for me is already hinted at  in a close call   i had android over apple  some things that seem clear apple wins   werent so much to me for idiosyncratic reasons like apps  ease of use and ecosystem were much closer   where apple gets a leg up is in popularity   who has one  damn near everyone which leads into the walled garden and ecosystem  currently using  ip  but ill end up on the p due to esim issues 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i felt like you knew android is better in anyway but was just biased on your conclusion bcz of your affiliation with us 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marques is very objective here  all the points have been taken out  kudos 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im coming up on  years with my first iphone   mini  and i cant wait to get rid of this pos and go back to android   prolly a z flip  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the one major thing you failed to mention during your battery spiel was the inability to get true battery health stats from android devices  the system just doesnt have this at the api level  and is extremely difficult to get accurate readings from  usually involving thirdparty apps monitoring your cpu usage and the like to even get a tiny grasp of your devices battery health  this is a major point for ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,tbh  i think that one aspect that keeps pushing me away from iphones is the fact that i dont want to have the same freaking phone every iphone user has  and i really mean it  if you have an iphone you have the same phone that millions have had since iphone  = 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,naaah bro  android wins the echosystem 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video  i tell friends and family all the time that it is just a matter of preference  however  i always recommend an iphone to elderly family  i personally think its more simpler to use  as a tech person  i have to have both just so i am up to date with both  but android products are what i use on the daily 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, customer service basically always better for an iphone     in which parallel universe 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use is definitely not apple it hase terrible file management system than android you cant even download a file from browser that easily on apple ios and for security   privacy you can turn off   on permission for each and every app separately for file sharing with other platforms like linux  windows  even with mac definitely android is a king if my mom want to download certain images or videos with ios she got sick   but with android its very easy so definitely dont agree with marcus brown lee in ease of use
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android does have a focus mode  its just not called focus
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,switching between next generation of same phones should have a category or a sub category  im an android user for years but i would say iphone is a definitive winner
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this video was soooooooooo predictable
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android anytime any day  iphone is  and boring
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i know facetime and imessage are very important to the usa residents but outside usa those are not deal breakers by any means  actually in my country though apple phones are popular but almost no one use imessage and facetime
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,super nice video  we are lucky to have all these techs available  pock one and you wont be wrong
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i was once a lover of the google products like pixels but once i switched to apple products i ain’t coming back   ease of use   apps top notch 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios is not really optimized  its more of a limited os  the keyword here is limited not optimized 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is the best  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,totally agree with this   i used to be an android person  i loved android’s sky’s the limit kind of customizability   as i get older and busier  i starting to like simplicity  smooth operation i want a reliable phone and apps — that i can count on anytime  that’s not buggy and wont crash on me   i became an apple user 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,never had one pop up  ever  on an iphone  + years  the other day  my friend was navigating with his android phone  and just in driving a little bit  several pop ups came up  and you know what  we couldnt even figure out which app was causing this  nuts  no thank you  not for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marques  i love your style and easy to understand presentations 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,customisation   features             apps                   excitement        updates             ease of use       ecosystem        android               i think both ecosystems are pretty much the same at this point but honestly customisation for me comes on top follow by ecosystem  i got the latest pixel and integration is by far flowless 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps and how they flow on the phone  and for me i’ll have to give that to apple  basic apps such as instagram or whatsapp feel like really premium to the use  not talking about money   and as i read saw somewhere else and now confirm with marques  developers develop apple apps to run at full quality on apple devices  they probably dedicate more time to making them almost perfect since they’ll be used pretty much on all line ups with no changes or adjustments  contrary to android  where standard wouldn’t fit for all the phones 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,idk if i live in a third world country but i have been thinking a lot in the reselling price for changing my phone  cause here ssg looses their value so faster that the investment hardly will be closer in a trade off
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios still sucks in file management  it is getting really beyond annoying and wasting of my time 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the way the categories are chosen  understood that he will choose apple over android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,continuity features 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,never ever will i be the iphones slave   f that bs  i need my freedom
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,very nice analysis  thank you bro 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,are those naruto and goku skins  yesssssss
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,s pen sales me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im gonna have to disagree with ease of use  your definition of ease of use didnt take into account new users  i can guarantee that if you put a person who hasnt used either system  they will tell you android is easier to use  so saying iphone is easier to use for those who have always been using it does not mean they are easier to use   as well  while i understand and agree with your definition of ecosystem and why iphones are better  for me that category is actually a minus for the same reason mentioned earlier in regards to walling you in etc 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,galaxy s ultra tuning ios should be good
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my iphone  pro max wont turn on  cant even log into itunes or set up and apple appointment with two step verification  bc my phone wont turn on  had iphones for ever  but kinda thinking about s ultra  i got a pc laptop already 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,politics 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use should have gone with android  as long as you can customise it to be so simple to you  but you chose apple and i have no idea why   broad models and price catagories should have gone to the list as well   android will definitely win 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for ease of use i prefer android  how easily you can access the notifications panel  quick settings  swtting button on top  easy copy paste and most importantly how easily you can navigate the cursor in a word  for android its one tap and it will put the cursor there 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wow the rubric is awesome   this is the best way to rate and yes which one is the best really up to an individual   i have been android user until when i was given iphone  pro max as a gift   ever since that the ease of use and ecosystem have been great for me   i remember using iphone  at work and that time really did not understand why anyone would want to use an iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,love the way you end rating the systems  excellently explained 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it was a very bad idea to do this video
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,youre doing an awesome job with your content  i really appreciate how mature and insightful it is  its evident that you put a lot of time and effort into making it top notch  your commitment to getting even better over time is super inspiring  not everyone can maintain such high standards and keep evolving like you do    your videos are a real gem for your audience  and im excited to see where your journey leads you in the future 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphones suck
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how is the mac pro with a plant in it levitating 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this guy is a legend he dropped this video  days ago and well over a million views like he get more views then some rappers i know damn 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  i wish that was the name of this video  just for the non techy people who dont understand that its not android versus iphone because thats an operating system versus a phone instead of it being an operating system versus operating system 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as an apple user   holy sh t their ecosystem is limiting and overrated
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,repairability is the main factor that makes android ecosystem far more popular in brasil 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, logo     so yeah 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, the winner is us  because they are competing against each other to give the customers the best  nailed it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ok but what about windows phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one of the things missed in the apps section is the ability to side load apps on android phones  the ios app store is notoriously limiting  you can put whatever you want on your android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im still using a s+  how many times did yall buy a new phone lol  all i gotta do is replace the battery and its as good as new  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the apple closed ecosystem should be considered a negative
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android makes it very easy for me to bypass carrier limitations  i e  t mobiles download speed throttling  on video streaming and hotspot usage  and these are high on my list of priorities  it isnt possible to do the same on ios without jailbreaking the phone  its a shame  too  as id love to swap my pebble out for an apple watch  but ill probably have to spring for a garmin something or other instead  ill add that if youre willing to go through the hassle of installing a custom rom  you can get effectively indefinite longevity out of any of the more hackable android phones  e g  google pixel  oneplus  etc  however  i continue to recommend apple products to friends and family who arent very tech savvy as they provide the best experience for people who just want to watch youtube and browse instagram without thinking too hard about all the tech in between 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think in short for tech or phone enthusiast would prefer android more
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the winner is iphone plain and simple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,very good video
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,have you reviewed the saga android phone for dapps
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,having had both i still want android but their prices drop drastically in just like   years where apple really doesn’t drop and you always know how to on apple where android you need a video
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,instead of comparing androind samsung to apple you should have compared google pixel eco system to apple   google pixel is instant winner with much much better sync nd options
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the winner is samsung galaxy s ultra 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i use both systems and i can say that ios is prettier  but android is better in productivity and multimedia  thats all you need to know   in addition  android adapts more to you   you cant even cheat on your girl if youre using iphone because its not as customizable as android   so i ask you  in the end  what do you prefer   do you look good or be comfortable     once a girl told me that iphones are the best cell phones  but she only knows how to send messages and use tiktok and instagram so her opinion is not worth much    android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive used an iphone for a year and while i liked the experience  i do not like gestures for stuff like home back  i like having a back button that i can always trust to be in the same place and do the thing i expect  sometimes an app on ios will not have an back gesture and a small button at the top thats hard to reach and too small  having to constantly switch was tiresome 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you missed one major one   security and privacy  who is working for your privacy and who is selling your data and activity to advertisers  who does better security and encryption 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i had to return my iphone  pro max because it wouldnt register my fingertips touching the screen   i am back to s ultra and no problem  besides the pics are way better than iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android for me honestly  had both phones but customization is a big thing for me  so android for me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,did you use the same displays they used for the mandalorian as a bg  or is it just a lot of ambient light reflecting out of your face 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, customisation  in android is geared towards those who prefer spending a lot of time changing phone settings and how it looks feels etc aka geeks  nerds or those who don’t want to spend more than £ on a mobile phone    iphone on the other hand is for non nerdy geeky customers who prefer continuity and ease of use or those who exclusively live in apple  eco system 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is getting so boring
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as a student  i see my friends with iphones  in every class  having to convert photos of homework to jpeg before they can share them across platforms  a small example sure  but for me  apple has never been about ease of use for the consumer  if they were  the apple mouse would have the charging port on the front  not the bottom  the ipad  iphone  and mac would share the same charging ports  they would allow cross platform imessage  the list goes on and on  just even attempt getting photos off your iphone without using a mac with iphoto  just try it  its an absolute nightmare  apple just cannot win ease of use  while simultaneously winning ecosystem for being closed and controlled  those conflict  im surprised to see that apple was your choice for  ease of use 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i enjoyed this
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,honetsly  camera is all about why certain people choose iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my last  phones have been androids  but for the last   years  ive been working in the software industry  in a company that makes apps for both android and apple  you can basically do anything you want for android  but apple is really strict with their rules and you often have meetings with their representatives to make sure you are able to deliver the best user experience possible   after seeing that  im kind of convinced that ios is a much better  refined ecosystem  kind of leaning towards apple for my next phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,re appsd
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have never seen a company prioritise ios re app development efficiency and its not any harder to write android apps than ios  if a company is prioritising ios its because of the market share of ios users to android users
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marques what about apk files
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hes trying soo hard to give iphone some categorys 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,finally we cleared that up  iphone is better than android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,finally we cleared that up  iphone is better than android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,since this is a topic that comes up in certain circles  emulation is one of the main reasons i have a galaxy just the sheer amount of emulators and ported apps pc games  on android can be a huge deciding factor for some people ive convinced friends and family that prefer iphone for everything just to get a cheap android device strictly for emulation  especially since digital game preservation and backwards compatibility is an ongoing issue in the gaming community having access to retro games daily in your pocket is an absolute win
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,disagree  samsung ecosystem is  at least  s ultra  laptop book ultra  tablet s  watch s  tv oled  air conditioner  etc  it has features like quickshare 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think android should have won the apps category  yeah they may not be perfect  but there are so many apps to choose from  even the option to to get unknown apps  apple in my opinion is the king of ecosystem   how elsw are they going ti keep their sheep in one place… lmao 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android and its not even close
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  what phone is that with hz display  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,super powerful smartphone cameras are a gimmick and both apple and android are guilty  most users do not care and cannot tell the difference between any pictures taken with modern smartphones  what ends up happening is you just get a more goofy looking phone with each camera upgrade  its a gimmick that works but its a gimmick nonetheless
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you should put another  categories    affordability   choices
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well obviously there arent any android phones from  getting updates  they barely work on the os they shipped with after  years of use 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,customisation  android features  android easy of use   android update ios apps  android exitment  android ecosystem ios  my personal  experience the best in android  but video quality is awesome in ios but my vote is for android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,firehot_face 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the real winner is having a phone with the best of both worlds
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,team android   i was former iphone  but android had better new features and synchronization with pcs won me over   also  more customization 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,god  thank god i saved this video to watch later  mkbhd your the best    just like site selection criteria  based on what you use   your my everyday hope of becoming a tech youtuber 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the fact that i can use different app stores and side load apks is way better than social media apps being slightly better on apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i use both  ios personal phone android business phone  i see it like this ios is banl vault android is an open world  you decide how you want your info out there
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,surprised you didn’t mention how many widely used apps like x and ig usually run better on ios  snapchat camera quality etc
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,let me guess  apple is the winner  lol 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use for apple just because their home icons dont move  lmfao i had to google how to download apps from the app store just so it wouldnt ask me for my password every time
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think the conclusion is quite unexpected  but very clear  get the latest android phone  but always keep an iphone se close for imessage and facetime  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i very recently moved from ios to android  google pixel  amd am a huge fan of the file management systems on  android  makes transferring files across go pc so much easier  i also really appreciate how there are great android devices for a very low price if you know what you are looking for  very much in contrast to the iphone ecosystem  nice video though  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think the bottom line for the last point is that there’s no  android ecosystem  it’s third parties that create them  google has only a few products themselves and they abandon them without thinking twice 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marques  youre truly the best
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,price
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple pretty much has the us market in a death grip  they have successfully weaponized the well known tendency of teenagers towards cliqueness  by way of the blue   green bubble thing  in order to insure that pretty much every american under the age of  uses an iphone  and since most people dont switch ecosystems  when these people move out into the workplace and go on to live the rest of their lives  most of them will stay in the apple camp  outside of the usa though  things are a bit more even  in most of the rest of the  first world  nations  apple and android use is about   and then in the third world  android is king  but back in america  i think apple will dominate for a long time 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,file management  customisation  hate android  changes    sideloading for android  let alone folding  headphone jack or otherwise love experimentation  its a music emu device for me  the iphone benefits make total sense but i can upgrade downgrade updates too even if yes general support was the focus   i dont care about imessage  sure the sms mms rcs thing made sense but i dont care  also yes line in japan or others in other countries makes sense  sure brands but eh use whatever 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you cant batch delete contacts on android without logging into cloud  thats just dumb  its easy on an android to merge and organize contacts  ease of access to android  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is cleaner  probably more reliable and clean easy to use but i couldnt live without being able to download apps off google
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,regarding apps  you forgot to mention how you can sideload apps and even root them on android  i can get an adblocker through an apk easily on my pixel  but getting one on iphone is gonna be very difficult  another thing you should point out is how you can still use apps even if your software is outdated  android + can run most apps but if youre even still just on ios   youre screwed 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,updates support win  fairphone   years of proven support     years promised for the new fairphone   the company is even continuing to sell fairphone  parts for those who want to continue using it even though software updates will sunset    provides reasonable security information about use of an old phone that doesnt get updates 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no way in hell is apps an iphone advantage lol  the only reason it’s a priority is because devs will charge like   more on android then ios  shoot android lets you download an old apk and call it a day that’s android all day everyday everything else seems reasonable
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’m apple now for ease of use and support  my old androids would only get updates for  months and then slow way down when the next phone came out… never to get any fixes ever again  that being said the best phone   smartwatch setup i ever had was pebble with android  when i switched back to ios the pebble watch became a brick  nearly all the apps and functions that made it so good were being held back by apple  and argubly this was the nail in the coffin for pebble as a company… apple watch came out a few months later and it still isn’t as functional of a smartwatch as pebble was  this is always the achilles heel of apple  if their cheif product designer doesn’t understand how a feature significantly makes it better the community is stuck with lost potential 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i personally switched to ios cuz i like the dynamic island too much for the amount it can do  i grew with both systems and i hardly understand that both systems have their pros and cons  ios laks when it comes to new features  a lot of people laugh when ios gets ‘new’ shit where as android had it for multiple years  same as marques said  it really depends on what features are most important to you and yes  android has more features overall when it comes to having different brands  but iphone is just simple and not everybody wishes to customize their phone by perfection  as long as it can make phone calls  send messages  make at least some good   doesn’t have to be best quality  pictures and do facebook  for most elders  they are fine with a cheaper model  and mostly that will be android or an older iphone  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot a very important criteria  affordability  now i have an iphone  but let me tell you  android offers tons of different phones and devices and they range from very affordable ones  to really expensive ones  this allows people who are struggling financially to have access to the android system  or  if you care about having a certain device that you need to be really good  but another device which doesnt matter that much  you have the freedom to buy an expensive device and link it to a cheaper tablet for example  the comparison you made is more relevant to people living in the first world where buying a phone is not that big of a deal for how it effects the budget of people  but in many places  a new iphone can cost what equals a whole year of salary 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think your argument should largely be subjective to the usa cos the narrative is very different in most parts of the world  you can do better 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple ecosystem vs samsung ecosystem… would you please make us that a video   would love to watch it
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in my days my daily driver was android and my family uses ios  therefore i grew up with both systems by some kind of way  i guess it’s a tie when it comes to which is better  both have pros and cons and it has to be cuz there needs to be a competition and different brands with their own way to create some phone with certain features for a certain price  my android had a finger reader on the back  now it’s face id  i like both cuz it don’t matter which  i use  getting the phone out of the pocket and my finger is instantly on the back  or swipe up and you are in as well  this really depends on small details  same with other stuff  you like a fingerprint scanner on the front  go ahead  but you will loose other stuff depending on the phone you get 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  is that plant floating back there 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,maybe harmony in the future
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,find my network is what kept me in the apple ecosystem
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’m pretty sure people are more excited to get an iphone than a samsung 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,love the message       their competing against each other  and we all win
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,let’s be honest in the business or working field either choice is good       it’s the social world  where iphone is king 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple apps are the bloatware  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,app advantage for ios  what about sideloding apps on android  i dont thintk thats yet possible on ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,is this a video we needed 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,camera and size are only real parameters in last  years  d
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,important additional category  security => iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,props for not pandering to both sides and calling it a draw  and props for giving people an easy way to break it down for themselves   my family all hates that i use an android so naturally i continue using it just to spite them   thats the most important factor to me    can i spite my family with this purchase   yes   sold 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great job 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me personally the repairability is also a huge factor  and with an iphone  you have to transfer the flash and wireless charging module when changing the back glass if you still want to be able to take pictures with flash  only to name one thing  this is honestly what keeps me from switching to ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,linux home networks with kde plasma + kdeconnect + all family has android phones > apple ecosystem   why  because we live in diverse cities  we can mount a directory with all the home movies from the aunt in seattle here in vancouver and watch them real time  then share a vlc streaming link so the cousin in la can also watch in his phone  try that with windows or macs 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the winner is us 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,cant even put iphone in the contest because its so locked down   until apple is required by law to provide an easy unlock  jailbreak  you cant feel like you actually even own the phone   for example  i dont want a company trying to tell me i cant use a great adblocker on my web browser   without that  any phone belongs in the garbage  period 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,who skipped directly to th end to see the result
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,file management on android is an essential feature for me iphone useres wont understand because they dont even know what an obb file is how files and folders are managed on android is very identical to the pc  you can see your game files where the game data and app data is stored where cache is stored can host ftp servers and manage ftp servers somethinbg i cant get on iphone on iphone you get whats know as locations and that consists of icloud  on my iphone and recently deleted and thats it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android allow me to schedule text messages  i heard ios dont have that feature
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well  i think because apps gets to work fine on way older android version even after the phone stops getting updates makes android a much more usable phone  iphones will stop allowing users download or run apps in less than  years after the phone stops getting ios updates  its almost like apple forces the older phones to become useless
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hmm  in future comparisons  id encourage also looking at resale value  security privacy  repairability and service  what else 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the updates category definitely doesnt go to the iphone because they intintially degrade the phone each year 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont find apples interface intuitive at all  even on androids where i have the option to replace this with swipes or gestures or whatever  i need a back button  home screen button   task manager button to navigate the phone  its what i am used to  carried forward from my experience with pcs   androids file manager is the other thing that i cant do without 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,saved millions 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the main missing feature on iphone is split screen
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,customization 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my oppo ak has focus mood so 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the ending was way more epic   the winner is us 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,without watching this video i know what will be your conclusion this is a paid promotional video before launching iphone  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marquee you’re failing to mention apple imessage uses internet connection to send clear videos and pics  samsung uses sms and so videos are grainy and such and can’t send messages over wifi on a cruise like you can with apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i havent switched to iphone cause they dont innovate like say samsung  they change a couple small things and release a new phone  like if you look at the difference between a  year old samsung device there is big differences  and they innovate folding phones cameras curved screens etc  i have an s+ still and its an incredible phone even today still lighting fast great screen quality excellent battery life and i use it   for work and entertainment i watch movies and tv on my phone its the device i use most   also the samsung ecosystem is becoming really competitive having similar airdrop copy links on my phone and open on my tablet sync with notes etc 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i like android more  but now that i am busy adult with kids etc  i find it so easy to use apple ecosystem  everything just works so easy out of the box  it also gives me some kind of peace of mind that i cannot customize the os too much  like i am not missing out on any awesome features because i have no time or energy to customize 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i understand you have to make this look competitive  but there isnt really a competition here  features  please be real  you used   exceptions to imply android has the better features   or more features  which is irrelevant  and makes the concept of features the same as customization  in reality  for the vast majority of users  the iphone has the superior feature set   with better performance  security  consistency  usability  and thus far more likelihood that features are used  which is why iphone crushes android in content creation and consumption  btw  notice that you didnt list performance and security on your list too  which i guess you considered unfair due to the iphone crushing android there too  excitement too  i understand your point  but seriously  there is never an android phone that causes buyers to literally line up and camp outside the store for days  nothing generates excitement like a new iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,battery life 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,price  right to repairability  price of repairs  accessory availability compatibility  not appreciable  marques 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  did someone else notice that glitch too  the wallpaper seems added by the video editor on top
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i will choose android any day
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android   life
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple admitted they slow down their older models on purpose   if that doesnt make you want to buy an android instead  nothing else will  idiots 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have question do android really need updation like iphone do   because i think the android  is the base isnt it   android os is stronger than ios  you can use the android os for years even you dont get the new version of android  it doesnt matter 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this video was sponsored by apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i wish marques was not so us biased  since this is youtube and he has a global audience  literally no one uses imessage but he considers it an advantage 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,sure   iphone is easy to use   but android have alot an indie game with ads everywhere every time you wanna play  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my question is  how the hell does mkbhd still get tweetbot access 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,updates and support drove me to finally move to apple  i hated waiting a year or so for the newest version of android and i always bought flagship handsets 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think one of the biggest feature differences between the phones is file transfer  on android  your phone is a full on file management device  you can plug it into the computer and transfer anything to and from it  with iphone  you have rock solid airdrop  which only works with other apple devices but works insanely well  i went and got an iphone because i love the design and have a windows laptop  a shortcut makes file transfer still very easy tho
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,yes  but how much androids have access to that features   so ill say is ios have more features since all ios devices have that features 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i still would use android anytime its just what im used to using
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,can you please let me know what is the name of the iphone stand that you showed  that you turn the iphone to portrait mode
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,software updates are not the same on android and iphone  in case of ios there is one big update that updates everything  also older iphones dont get a lot of features  in case of android there is project mainline which means a lot of components and apps are updated by google from the play store regardless of android version  this means that older phones still get some features  one example is nearby share which older devices also got  android has gotten way better with updates  a lot of flagships offer at least  years of security updates 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,   quality over quantity my friends   > is this quote for linus tech tips   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple fight against +  android company 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you should put ease of access  and then see the results 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, partially biased      first you say  i give this point to apple because im in the us and the ecosystem advantage is strong  and then claim the  objective winner is apple   wow   you dont even consider listing sideloading apps in the apps  or other  category  which is obviously an android strength
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,love the windows mac imagery in the back
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the day theres a decent android watch is the day ill replace my iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you should have considered one more category  say  mass application  that defines how big the mass of the population is actually capable of utilising the phone well     majority of the population cant afford an iphone   majority of the population cant afford to have ecosystem of either apple or android   population that enjoys the complete ecosystem of iphone is only a minor part of entire userbase 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you know  it’s not all about customization  i have an iphone for my personal phone  an android for my work phone and hands down  my iphone is much more stable than my android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,let me save you  minutes  at the end   your choice is all subjective
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,updates    cmon apple gives update to kill the old phones  in terms of android there exists custom roms  i wonder why the guy who uses nexus  in mkbhd studio didnt remind him about that    
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im just tired of that one android user in the group messing up the group chat 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,then comes mod apks   now do we have to choose  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hey marques  thats honestly the best review i have seen so far  zero biasness  viewers can prioritize their categories and decide the best outcome  loved the conclusion  we users are the winners as they are the competitors  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hard decisions  i always want a phone where price and what you get is as close as possible  and where i have the best camera  charging  and customizing  i some how also enjoy not getting the same as everyone els
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it’s like petite or latina
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,talking about updates  i feel like ios updates are really minor updates compared to android updates  the os update changes on ios are like app updates on android  but the security patch update is commendable 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"all of you  and especially marques  do not understand the main difference between apple and android  the iphone is only for rich people in rich countries  period  for iphone  you have to have good and high speed internet to work with icloud  airdrop  etc  you need the entire apple ecosystem  including macbook  apple watch or ipad  to comfortably work with the same file system  and im not talking about the price for the iphone itself and prices for repairing services or prices for the apple accessories "
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android all the way  i rather not use a phone for a day then having to use an iphone for a day  i remember when iphone x came out i thought it looked nice so i gave iphone a try and after  minutes i hated the ios software and return to to best best the very same day  gave me a headache  never again would i ever use an apple product  i  samsung galaxy phones
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thanks for making this video  as an android user im constantly attacked  i had an iphone for several years  ipad  macbook pro  air  etc  and i personally prefer the customization abilities  features and the samsung ecosystem over an iphone at this time  but i bring this up because i feel like its becoming a problem and yet another way to stigmatize people  if folks understood more about each phone  and therefore what theyre talking about when approaching an android user  i think its a win win for everyone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you mean ios vs android i guess 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i understand that the video was about the stock experience from both os    but i really missed marques didnt talk mention about custom thing that we have on android community  like custom roms  that expand the lifetime of one device and custom launchers  in customization 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone >  customization is useless if you own an android ur not it
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,honestly  as an iphone user that was previously on android for all of my phones  i think that both are powerhouses in their own right  it ultimately comes down to what you want and not what others think of you  i got bored on android because i was so used to it but i also think iphone users should try android at least once  i love my iphone  pro max  i find myself in marvel at how amazing the ecosystem is with my m macbook air  airpods max  and my airpods pro nd gen  it’s the little things in ios that blow me away  whereas on android i always felt like i was in a ferrari that was limited by regular roads  i do miss certain things about android  such as the samsung cameras at times  but iphones feel more premium and integrated to me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the best phone is and will always be the one that covers your needs as a user
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the most important category for me was not listed  security  and for that reason  iphone is still the king 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as an iphone user i agree that the continuity and seamlessness of apples ecosystem is great  but  android still has the best feature  the ability to install apps remotely on a laptop on the playstore 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there are really only  real reasons i use apple    privacy and   the ecosystem that allows for seamless workflow  like i can cmd+c on my macbook to copy and then tap  paste  on my iphone—never thought id ever need that feature but now i use it all the frigging time  and also data transfer backups  tracking remote erasing lost devices  etc  that being said  i never get excited to get a new iphone  even if its been years since i got a new one  i use iphones until theyre dead  theyre pretty much exactly the same except with a few things changed every new device  im basically just switching out an old black rectangle for a new black rectangle  however  i do get excited about new os updates or a new os generation  as long as its still compatible with my device  because thats where i see all the major changes and improvements in features   tldr  i just want a phone with good privacy and seamless workflow  dont care about customization  hence  i use iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,happy to see pixel  line bringing  years of major updates  ps when talking about ecosystem as both iphone and pixel user  pixel is catching up with the  ecosystem  devices and integration  yet i even see it more as a plus on android because of freedom and compability with other products and hardware 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,watching this on my s ultra listening with my galaxy buds  controlling the volume on my galaxy watch  maybe later ill watch a different video on my tab s plus 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont text much and the people i do text have rcs  or use discord  imessage has never been of interest to me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hi marquez interesting video  personally to me the ecosystem part of android is not just that the same company makes things that work together  android has always been the open ecosystem  that through the openness of the system  i can have a bose speaker  use spotify  run on google cloud for work  microsoft office  have a samsung tv  a pixel watch etc and everything works together so well  whereas with ios you can have lots of apple stuff work together but the second you go outside of it it all falls to pieces  it becomes super hard for instance to use a non ios keyboard  or to connect to a samsung tv for instance for to hook up to alexa systems  or run amazon fire tv etc  i know most people dont want this  they get a mac and an iphone and it works together but it does the same with android  annoyingly with the exception that it is hard to take videos and send them to a mac  but that is in apple not a limitation of the technology  also for ease of use for me  and admittedly im not the typical user  i find android so much easier to use  cause i can customise  spend an hour or so seeing it up to my work flow and life once rather than not having to set up but every day  every time i use something i make a compromise over that workflow
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i enjoyed this  samsung for me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there is one reason i dont get an iphone  sideliading  like what do you mean i pay the price of an actual full gaming pc and get a  general purpose  computing device  where i can only run things the company approves 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,mkbhd is scared to death  because the samsung fans may feel bad after this video
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so   you suggest that i sell my kidney and buy an iphone and an android and use both of them
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple still got no foldables  no flips  amy be a cool factor category and on other side  who are not in the us  we would have to buy lot of other apple products to be in the ecosystem finally  one other category  the budget  android phones are available frok k to k  while apple starts from min k    the max selling category isn k   k in india  the apple is more of a status symbol here 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as a mac and android user in argentina  this is my take   i dont really care about the ecosystem  no one here uses neither imessage or facetime  in fact  its considered bloatware   the calculator app on the iphone is the worst app ever made  you cant even see the calculation you are doing  you only see the last number you input  you dont even see the operator you entered  of course you dont have history  its lame   but the worst part of an iphone its the notification management  i cant believe theres no icon indicator in the status bar telling you about a notification  i know theres the notification number on each app  but if its not an app you have on your main screen you can easily miss it  and lets be straight  how many people do you know that have  unread emails  how can these people tell if the got a new email  yes i know theres the locks green and the notifications pull down  but every iphone owner i know has it absolutely flooded with random old notifications   and this is coming from a years mac user  but android has much better  ease of use  imo   theres more stuff too  but i dont wanna get in too deep  autocorrect on the last word before sending  the  back  and  home  gestures are just better on android  volume controls  etc 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have an android phone and an iphone so to be honest it depends on how you use your phone  needs etc name it they both are useful and unique in their own way so imo
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you need to give samsung  point since at one point it seems you’re comparing apple vs samsung 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there are no winners lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,having used both platforms extensively for many years i have to say android wins hands down this wasnt previously the case but certainly in recent years it has absolutely no doubts
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,am i the only one who missed marques mentioning rd party app installation
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i got all the way up to an iphone s   it was android ever since   it was always screen real estate and customization for me   now its a battle between pixel and galaxy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,of course apple won  who is surprise  byiest video lol 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,opensource app is android win
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is the winer for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple no 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,huh apple guy talk about android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wallpapers link  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple updates your phone so long with mandatory updates so they can gimp your phone tablet  i had a forced update they made my perfectly functioning keyboard a lagging mess 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hey marques  can you do a follow up video on how apple pay vs samsung or google pay  and apple car play vs android auto  thanks 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung moving s pen to the left side just irked me so bad  i mean  it was just a horrible move  i cant believe they did it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple always tried to treat me like i was a retarded baby who has never seen an electronic device before  android treats me like an adult who has autonomy over my own decisions   easy choice imo
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love your channel but kind of disappointed with this video  not because of the winner  but because of the categories  excitement  apps  even ecosystem are lazy choices  how about things that actually matter to the average user like privacy security  durability  lots of better thing to dive into 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marques quietly building one of the largest mcda experiments is  chef’s kiss 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,actually ecosystem usefulness depends on country eg  india its difficult to share things to iphone and vice versa
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i went from android  oneplus  pro and realme gt  pro  and there were some things i expected   less customization   but  i thought on other things that would be closer  or simpler in ios   notification are pretty lousy  alarm clock and widget plainly suck  more clicks   but  however  for some users ios is good and easy   more flexible  easier  faster 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i like how you bring the discussion between these both systems  totally agree  and unfortunately  always facing the issue of which one is better with others lol  thanks for been objective here 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,disagree on apps because of integration  because of apple’s walled garden  third party accessories become severely limited  and usually the third party accessories are better than the apple version but the lack of integration can hurt the value of the device  ex  fitbits or rd party earbuds   great video though
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the ease of use of apple devices is sadly going down while features are increasing  ive used apple products for the last  years  and in the last  or  years ive seen bugs and unexpected behaviors that i would have never seen on apple devices before 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple are years behind
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,who absolutely celebrated whilst on their iphone let’s gooo yeah yeah yeah i’m on iphone  and depressed yeahhhhh
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,sounds like you have listened to the land of the giants podcast where they used the same system for tesla v evs
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,x > threads
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,custom  apks was missing from apps  but i am curious if the use of that actually changed the app decision
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its android for me  too 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how about the iphone starts selling back the same old keypad phones with minimal things to do  thats the best ease of use as per this  staying outdated and restricting users with the amount of things they can do is not ease of use but stupidity of brand conscious iphone users  the only day i would buy a iphone is when iphone beats a galaxy in the amount of cool things they can do on their phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,cool factor  i want an mkbhd score at the end of your next review 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot to mention the android  ease of use  mode  final results   for android and  for apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how about pricing  budget deserves a spot on the list id say 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is the scientology of tech  once you are in you cannot get out
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in india  we have one more category that has a top noth priority for some  this is the  show off factor 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,category eight  camera shutter speed  iphone wins by a landslide 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,partitioned work profile on android  i dont want to have to carry a personal and a work phone  and my company can wipe the partition anytime they need to  on iphone since there is no partition they could wipe the entire phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android has so many more features  its like an iphone with ipad capabilities  like desktop mode and mouse and keyboard support  iphones are literally for people who have no clue about tech and to much money  it just fits perfect that this is the standard in the us   like they are so proud of their liberty and freedom but they let their  so personal  phone decision and use be dictated by the richest and most greedy company  that forces everybody to use the same phone otherwise you are excuded from the family group chat  this is real communism here but a company has the power and you still have to pay a premium price for it  this is so ridiculus 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,that is why i am using both 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what a very interesting post loved it  iam a former apple enthusiast and now a huge android fan  my last iphone was c  i believe that android offers way better value for someone in developing countries around the world  excitement however from where i seat goes to apple  because of their ecosystem  simplified product set  premium appeal as well as their marketing genius  they generate more excitement even if at the end everything announced is copied 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,disagree so much on apps  android hands down wins that  agree with everything else 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,background is dodgy
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you should include two very important categories and   price  because of youre stuck with the five year old phone you lag far behind  in this case  the google suite of integrated tech seems superior  the camera related google apps crush apple  lens is so powerful  its like apple maps compared to google maps  also google assistant is far better than siri  and thats before google integrated bard and sge  etc  it will take apple years to catch google
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the winner is us the consumer 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,some slightly daft categories here   you  customise  something to improve its  ease of use  surely  and to make it more  exciting  for you to use   its an interesting exercise  but hasnt helped me talk my son out of getting an iphone =}
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one thing i am missing here is hardware    and i think using samsung ecosystem here is pretty unfair  because it is about android  not samsung  if you use only samsung phones you have way less features for example as well  like the super fast charging  super long battery life etc 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,winner android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think  big category missing here is value for the money  android will win that one
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you just look at it objectivly  android phones would always win  with iphones you have no choice but really high prices and you will always find an android which has all the same features  apple exclusiv features always have an android alternative there are no limits  for less money   nearly all arguments for an iphone are subjectiv preferences  you only have  if you used to it or already spend too much on the closed and incomatible apple ecosystem 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iv always hava a android  but for some time when i got a new job that give me an iphone im all lost and dont wanna go back to android  but now im also a little older and dont want to change allot  just wanna have a phone that works  in my opinion iphone is the winner now in  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dealbreaker to me is always software support
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,congrats marquees  with your unbelievable views  you’re the man  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,windows  samsung play great together now as well  i tried apple for a little bit   even love my mba   but couldnt stand the iphone  pro max  overheating issues   having to do things the apple way and the very closed eco system just killed it for me  loved the security and privacy focus   but not enough to put up with the iphone  really wish my mba played nice with android phones   but it didnt so my new laptop is a windows machine  loved the video tho  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in general a very good take on that  especially with the possibility to give priorities and therefore get your own winner  but there are a few points missing   for apps  one big disadvantage ios has is you cant install apps which are not from the app store  that means for example as epic games doesnt agree with some policies of the apple app store they arent available in it and it means no game of them is available on any ios device  they are not in the play store as well but i can still use them and that is only one example  another point is  in europe priorities are different than in the us and here especially smaller companies they do update or develop apps for android first as there are way more users  and they dont have the capacity to develop both at the same time and its not worth for the few iphone users  also many developers in europe are completely against apple  bc somethings are more complicated and especially way more restricted  on an android with a few taps you are in developer settings and can change anything  or you simply copy an  apk file on an android device and install it and boom it works   second point is the update situation  while ios might still win  it is a lot closer than said in the video  bc android has one big advantage over ios  even after an android device doesnt get security patches you still get updates for every app and therefore still get security updates inside an an app as well as the newest features  also you get every update from the google services in the background without even noticing it and therefore quite big securty improvements although your phone doesnt get the classic security patches  the reason is because these are all more or less completely independent from the android version you are using  on the other hand if you have an apple devide which doesnt have the newest ios version you dont get updates for your apps and therefore no security updates at all after this point  also then apps simply wont work anymore  another point is that apple doesnt guarantee you how long you get updates  while most manufacturers from android devices do  google for example does guarantee  years of updates for the pixel devices  the possibility that it will get security patches even longer is there  but as apple usually does give you updates even longer also without a guarantee i would still give the win to them  but only very slightly especially as very few people keep there phones or tablets longer than  years   the last point is the ecosystem  yes  apple does advertise this very good while most android manufacturers do not  but as said in the video android can do literally anything ios can  but big advantage and that moves the point here to android for me and probably many other people is that you can use devices from different brands and even different operating systems as android does work quite well with windows for example  you may not get every feature between every brand but in general they all work together quite well  so you are not forced to buy products from the same brand which is in case of apple where at least here in europe products are very expensive really a big disadvantage and kind of a joke that they more or less do not work with any other device at all and if than its most of the time a solution from the other brand and not apple  also as said in the video lets not forget the amount of adapters and accessories you need for apple devices for example to simply use a projector or connect to a monitor and the different charging cables  you can use a usb c to charge you android phone and tablet and your windows computer or chromebook  so in general the open ecosystem and the extremely big variety of devices to choose from makes android win this category for me and should make it a win for everbody who wants to be able to use a device from another brand  also in europe communication runs more or less a   over whatsapp or signal and not imessage  also icloud isnt that popular bc of way less iphone user compared to the us  also companies here mostly use windows computers and android phones very rarely apple products  so even without prioritizing certain categories i think it is a slight win for android for most people especially in europe
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps part is a lie  so you are saying  all iphones  and all ipads have the same aspect ratio and refresh ratio  fragmentation is the word that fanboys stopped using after iphone got    new devices per years instead of one 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think it’s so stupid that people even argue about this  different people prioritize different things  there is no one  better  product for everybody  i have used both android and ios back and forth for a number of years and generally find myself gravitating towards ios  but i have no problem with either  any modern day flagship device will comfortably do anything you need it to do  we should really stop making such a big deal about who uses what  who really cares 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,get a life 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lol 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for updates  funny how you didnt even mention pixel phones  they get the updates on same day   so if you compare iphones x pixels 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there is no apple store  everywhere  maybe it is that way in one or a few countries however  i live in india and can say there is definitely no apple store everywhere here for sure
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is the best comparison vid ever i have seen  like marq said    theyre competting against each other to get better    its fun to see how good these companies try to make a good product for their users  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,which song was used in the intro 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hello nice video cool 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i was an android user for years  but the quality and experience of using an iphone won me over  especially siri  to me  siri is just so much easier to use than google assistant  and you cant get spatial audio on android  and i love spatial audio also  the ecosystem between my iphone and laptop is uncanny  i was an android user for a decade but now im an iphone user for life 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the most stubborn person is an android user who wont switch to iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,two categories that are major factors for me are missing     apple by a mile  no competition    again  apple  androids are neat  and this was touched on with the features tradeoff with ease of use  this goes for hardware  battery life and software stability— apple wins  objectively 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the best phone is the phone we made along the way  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android for the winner  there is so much flexibility and openness i feel very welcomed 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, nice video apple fan 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,that thing you said about focus modes at   has been with samsung for quite a while since the introduction of modes and routines
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,should anyone talk about iphone  pro battery problem  someone getting fast degrading battery health and someone  me  fast degrading battery percentage  in idle mode it just literally drop to     bettery charge loss in  hours in idle mode is something intriguing  n b= aod is turned off
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why do i feel like the second time he said quality over quantity is directly referring to  mrwhostheboss
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,only one apple store in india
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no one uses imessages or facetime outside of the us tho
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how interesting that the ecosystem is the category to weigh this in favor of apple  i can totally understand your point  but for me it is exactly that same ecosystem that is keeping me from buying an iphone  i just dont want to be forever locked into choosing apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios being easy to use is a myth  been like that for years  one thing is continuity  you are used to the systems  and the other is get a person not used to a phone  and ask them to use it  iphones are terrible to use   example  try to send a picture via email on android and ios  on android you have at least  ways  on iphone its so stupid and complicated  the fact you cannot hide icons on ios and have that huge mess of icons everywhere  its enough to say android are easier
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,really  the app section shouldve been a draw     for both  which wouldve made it a tie overall   you can download moded apks on android and even get pro apps for free   what about rooted apps  you can play some console games on android with some app modifications   there is just a lot of things with apps that the score shouldnt have just gone to ios like that
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video  not agreed with the  apps  category for the iphone  thats an easy win for android   quantity is freedom to choose in most cases  and is more than double on the android side  i totally prefer to have more apps to choose than having the latest update for some app a couple of weeks sooner  in most cases latest updates dont make any difference 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how is there no  cost  category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the battery life of the i phone sucks
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apples ecosystem is what keeps me away from an iphone  i can admit that its very well done but its so limiting to the user that it feels like apple is big brother and will send an agent around to your house if you dare use a non compatible device 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marvelous
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lets see the eco system battle  deep dive  please   do it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this actually got me curious  do apple users even watch these videos to see what is better  because majority of apple users will always only buy the next iphone  then they want the air pods  then they buy the apple watch   some will even hate the other options just because they are not apple   so if most of them are not looking for anything else  would they even watch how other options are or not 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,focus modes are available on android as well but more fleshed out on samsungs 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so in conclusion if youre in usa apple is better  but if youre everywhere else in the world  even antarctica  android wins
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about performance  security and cost efficiency 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,not surprised the win goes to ios  you arent called marques  bias  brownlee for no reason  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ultimately it boils down to what you prefer  i have both iphone and samsung and they are both good in my opinion  iphone is less lag when i open the camera but samsung takes better photos  so  yup 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung has focus mode and even behavior based actions  in routine
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  easy of use    apps              updates       features       ecosystem    excitement    customization   vs   +  for price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,shout out to android and huawei ecosystem 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,updates are a double edged sword  i usually just skip them  besides security updates  because generally they just make the device slower  ive noticed this with my macbook  apple ruined my mb pro late  with updates years ago  and the same applies for android  i just dont bother with updates  there will almost never be features you need anyways  so i think the whole  support update  point is kinda pointless  security updates though  those are meaningful  can you even get separate security updates on ios like you can on android  i doubt 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i believe a lot of this rests on what you started with  probably a very small percentage of people who start out with and get used to one platform will ever see anything in the other platform that is actually compelling enough to make them switch  and so they will die on the hill defending why their platform is better  i dont see better  just different 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wonder why he skipped about price  guess being rich youtuber has its own privilege 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,mine is ecosystem and ease of use  i have both but i use the iphone the most becuase im a mac user and the seemless integration of the apple ecosystem is a daily driver for me  oh and i do not use the lighting charger  i prefer the magsafe  and i have this confidence that apps on ios are always reliable 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is called a real or worth content
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i tried to switch to android via pixel for over a year went back to apple just last month sry its just easier to use and do everything i want to do 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,definitely android for me  i love iphone a lottttt because of camera quality  privacy and ad free apps but android is much more easier for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,both are awesome 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bang for the buck
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my first phone was google nexus one   and after that hawai   all the samsung notes until the    iphone now i have the  pro max and i prefer iphone   only for imessage    the ecosystem and the updates …  android after one year good luck if u got some updates
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i jump from my iphone  pro max to my galaxy flip   just got the   every few weeks just to ring the changes  i ignore any opinion as to which is best from those who have no used both systems   recently  as they are always updating  i hear from people who have only ever used an iphone that they think android is no good  how do they know  likewise from android only users knocking iphones   until you spend some time in both ecosystems you cannot have a valid opinion  thats how i see it  in all the years i have used both systems i come down  slightly  on the side of ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android for me  inexpensive  lots of apps  can install apps from outside  lots of device to choose from and custom rom with root  love android    apple device are good but not for me  feels like a very restrictive device 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,love that mknhd  we are the winners 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,yas  we are the real winner on this battle  they need to do research about us  and technological error and testing to be able to win our money   im from the philippines though  and i think in all the categories the winner  is  android  except for the excitement chuchu 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lol  i am a hard working adult   i don’t care and don’t waste my time by changing the color of the text oder set different background and styles … honestly who cares   it should just work
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so many other factors to consider that are important  for example  battery strength and lifecycle  also hardware durability etc
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont mind people who like apple  its what many people are used to and they fear the change of moving to something else  what i mind is how apple makes their customers bully people like me who refuse to get an apple and will never buy one  but now im the bad guy cause apple refuses to participate in rcs  and because its apparently too much to download google duo or some equivalent and i should just get an iphone so we can facetime  i have multiple friends who if apples talked with andriods  they would switch  but the only thing keeping them locked in is the fact that all their friends have apples
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,kinda feels bias considering the fact that android apps are a lot more 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, much love to android especially samsung
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i use both android and apple but i dont like too much controlled stuff that apple provides  android gives alot more features which is why i use it  apple on the other hand provides me with battery  face id and more security which is why i use it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as a european  i have never used facetime  i have some friends and family who use iphone  because they prefer the simplicity of ios  but they are very few 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,sorry  but samsung you can easy connect to macbook  but iphone to windows   it a hell
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my favorite phone samsung used it alot
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,excitement category should go to iphone  just look at google trends data  android may have better reasons to get excited  but iphone has way more excitement around it not even close 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot the developers side and apis…
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have a note  with verizon and an iphone  pro max with at t   i like the samsung better  because of the micro sd card  ease of use  i use the samsung   of the time and iphone   of the time
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when will aople allow home icons to be placed anywhere  its so hard to find some apps  and on a full sceen od apps if you move an app suddenly god help you fix all the screens 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about usable bluetooth on the iphone  doesnt apple still arbitrarily cripple that so that you cant easily send files to  or receive them from  a nearby android phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios and android are two distinct mobile operating systems with several differences      ecosystem        ios is exclusive to apple devices  such as the iphone and ipad       android is used by various manufacturers  including samsung  google  and many others  offering a wide range of device choices      user interface  ui       ios has a consistent  sleek  and minimalist ui design across all devices  with limited customization options       android allows for more customization  with diverse ui designs depending on the manufacturer and the ability to change default apps and widgets      app stores       ios has the apple app store  which is known for its strict review process and curated selection of apps       android uses the google play store  which has a larger app library but may have more varied quality due to a less strict review process  users can also sideload apps from other sources      hardware integration       ios is tightly integrated with apple hardware  which can lead to optimized performance and a seamless ecosystem for those using multiple apple devices       android is more versatile and can run on various hardware configurations  offering options for different budgets and preferences      updates       apple tends to release ios updates for a longer period  ensuring older devices receive updates for several years       android updates are dependent on the manufacturer  so some devices may receive fewer updates or for a shorter period      security       ios is often considered more secure due to its strict app review process  limited sideloading  and frequent updates       androids open nature can make it more susceptible to malware  but google has implemented security measures  and app permissions are more granular      customization       android allows for greater customization in terms of home screen layouts  widgets  and default apps       ios offers limited customization options  mainly changing wallpapers and rearranging app icons      voice assistants       ios uses siri as its voice assistant       android uses google assistant  which is deeply integrated into google services      cross platform compatibility       ios devices work well within the apple ecosystem  but they can be less compatible with non apple devices and services       android devices are generally more flexible and compatible with a wider range of platforms and services   ultimately  the choice between ios and android often comes down to personal preference  ecosystem allegiance  and specific needs  each has its strengths and weaknesses  catering to different user preferences and priorities 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps on android are unlimited ios are not
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ecosystem does not matter outside the us
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,personalization is everything  ease of use could be important for my grandma 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if your main phone is a pixel fold  why have an iphone as well  what are your reasons 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use is large way go to android  previous generation prefers it they feel iphone is so difficult for basic features
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this man will literally make the same videos each year with the newer phones  constant no brainer revenue stream  ive personally been unsubcribing from all these tech channels  all just hype and riding the train of new products constantly  all to get you to buy  perfectly fine with my oneplus  pro from  with custom xda dev software
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,awesome video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is the number one to me  apple products sucks we want to explore and we need no limits easy to use is the android not iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, apple is better  normies said even though only using it for message  youtube  and browsing  they not even using half of its capabilities  like any cheap android still can do that with way more affordable 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,best video of apple vs android i have seen  which actually gives you the answer what you need  amazing marques  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i don’t think the video is accurate  whether should be  iosxandroid or iphonexgalaxy or iphonexpixel… here you are comparing things that not all androids have  you are  combine all the good points  of all androids and using as if they were one phone…you could use all your points to compare two android phones… even then there is a lot of difference  i like your videos  but this one has in my opinion the wrong title…
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,just skipped to the end…these always end in  it’s a personal choice  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,customizing my screen  files  type c and more of diffrent selection of phones is why im been a android guy forever  only had one iphone i believe was a  it was only for  minutes lol before i went back to android  how many guys remember windows os  i tried that too  it was kool for a minute but definitely came back to android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is definitely better   its actually not hard to use   it lets you customize to moon   it lets you side load apps   it has a better file management   it has more app developers working on it   you can literally run a virtual machine on it   it has much less apps have stupid subscription plans   and many more small things  small things that make up a big thing   i wouldnt use an iphone as a main even if they gave it to me for free  you have almost no freedom in that phone and i believe people use it have stockholm syndrome 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wish i could have it both ways  android has better screens  better camera  to me  and customization options  remove the f ing play controls from the lock screen  apple has better security  or at least fewer malicious apps  better support from vendors  and integration in the apple environment 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android on steroids 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,pónganlo en es español como hicieron con los otros videos
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont like how limiting apples software is  i use linux on my laptop and desktop and i like the flexibility it offers me  android isnt as versatile  even though its technically just fancy java running on fancy linux  but it does offer far more  i love the ability to install apps from multiple app stores or git repos  i love having manual control over my file system  on some partitions at least  and i love that i can customize my ui like changing my launcher  android is definitely the superior platform for me and my needs  but i can certainly see the apeal of iphone  it just isnt for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,people use iphone because they dont understand simple things like customization  wanna pay more for things they could get in android for  times less money  either theyre rich dont care for money  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the background  windows vs mac green  xbox  vs blue  playstation 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for aome unknown reasons  all americans will just give all praise and prize to apple and iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’m writing this on an iphone to say i love android  it’s because of this damn ecosystem at our school is why i have to use an iphone  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wildest take in this vid was marques thinking i have  close friends
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  when i final moved to a mac and release they are the best for creative people  i also saved a heap of time  not customising my computer and just getting on with being creative  customising isn’t always a win 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how can apps can possible go to the iphone  on android you can sideload custom apps which overs you nearly endless possibilities  this is just not objective 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,are u making this cuz of bored of things  i mean  take a look at ur background and many missing animations i mean  the production isnt fully you  hm
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how come price is not a major category in your decision  iphone makes one model with one price  whereas android has many options for many people from different counties with different budgets  that for me is a super important aspect  how come its not for you 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when oh when will apple get app lock  im talking about a native app locker for every single app  not just specific apps 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my galaxy s and tab s both had focus mode 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the question is very difficult but you’ll try at your best    one only thing if i can  ios and ios support  years of major updates that summarize in  years of updates with last os version  iphone xr  exited on   will have ios updates until the end of  that is  years  but if we check last years we can see that we have at last one more year of security patches with previous os version  that is we can have a  years of supported patch releases  with ios we had  years of updates with last os and one more for security patches  that is  years total  with ios we had patches for  years  even if in last years we had patches released very seldom   so apple has not a fixed  stable patch updates policy even if it is  in practice  very long  surely more than android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,having an ios is like living in an hoa community   absolutely not for me  f that hoa or ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,playing safe there  but we all know you are fanatic of apple  and it s very obvious  i have both  but i am not gonna buy the highest price of iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android ftw  cant read online manga on ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android also have focus mode   brother and i give ecosystem to as draw both sides so   choices matter if a samsung user is accessible for their washing machine water heater home appliances that someone choice goes to samsung  ecosystem is bias thing u gave to apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i use both too  a iphone and samsung  they are both really good phones and each has it pros and cons
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i cant install apks in iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, appliances  where is the apple appliance
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is only applicable for us especially given that theres no price and that ecosystem point
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how many times have android executives been busted tweeting on  twitter for iphone  apps are way better on apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is just a waste of money and an apple with a bite to show off 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how about the pricetags 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i use both an iphone and a samsung together  iphone is easy to use for work because it pairs really well with my mac and ipad and it makes work a lot easier  on the other hand  i use my samsung phone with my watch for active stuff like swimming workouts and other exercises and its also where i listen to music with the buds and it works well with my tv and other appliances and basically all other non work stuff  i personally think  just basing on my experience with both  if someone were to choose just one the best device is decided by which house you live in  if you live in  house apple  then the iphone is best for you  if you live in  house samsung  then a samsung phone is best for you 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung you cant put widgets on the lockscreen anymore it sucks man  apple did this and did it really good
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you my friend just started a war 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,buy an apple phone  still their phone   buy an android phone  its yours and feels like it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well you said it yourself   you review devices fit for the usa  the whole world specially the nd and rd worlds are limited   their hands tied by ios   for example i have this old guy ask me to install facebook and youtube on ipadmini i couldnt  there is this guy with an iphone too hating that thing to death  but androids are very flexible a  device be working smooth installing new stuff and also maintainable           in addition the device to device transfer of apps and files where internet is unavailable is super great for us   if device is smashed we take out the memory card and move on  chargers are everywhere    a lot of real life options  for us android is like toyota  great of the average man  i believe africa  asia   south america prefer android  the usa and europe are the only ios pickers   winning in a small margin  so bruh i suggest you make your perspective a little wider 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps going to apple  which doesnt have sideloading = 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone doesnt have file manager  its the most useful thing ever   especially if you work remotely like me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,such a click bait title  but you got me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,macbook pro  that was my turning point  there is no competition from a provider that can also compete in the smartphone category  so samsung doesnt have a laptop to compete  if you have a macbook then the iphone ecosystem features along with airpods and watch are unmatched 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,u got it wrong on apps   there are tons of android apps which can help you customize your phone totally  activate certain settings with one click for example  or add tons of non stock visuals   like circles around the front camera   different battery percentage indicators etc  i mean  u could not really give it to the iphone given the fact that there are so many useful rd party apps for android  its not even a competition 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one point you left out in the apps section is that android actually easily allows to install non playstore apps with  apk files  that widens their ecosystem even further  also  during the time where i still used an iphone  apps used to cost more on the appstore than in the playstore  which is also a w for android  while i agree for the majority of your app assessment  you left these aspects out 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the fastest hardware on the planet   iphone  also carplay is so much better than android auto 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung ecosystem underrated af  they have way better compatibility with microsoft products which strongly increases productivity and workflow 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i do like how i can wear my airpod pro and switch between macbook pro and iphone without any effort at all  it just recognises what i’m trying to do  either a call  or a video and switches  with this ecosystem is top for me along with updates and apps 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how many times people use continuity in real life in a the long run 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think one of the problems  is that there are a gazillion different android phones  and almost as many android flavors and handset device manufacturer customizations   so comparing ios and android is intrinsically problematic 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you call it ease of use  i call it boring af
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,title says iphone vs android but is meant to be ios vs android  and the video ended up being more of iphone vs samsung instead  loved it still tho  huge fan
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so we just got gonna talk ab how mkbhds hand went behind only partially of the monitor screen behind him 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, and on the apps side  lots of app creators live  create and market to the us  where iphones are ubiquitous 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,on thing to put in mind  would you still buy apple phones if it uses android than ios   the point is people buy apple gadgets beacuse of the brand itself  why do people call iphone when you can call it a phone cellphone  would you call samsung for a samaung phone  of course not 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,necesito este video en español latino  te felicito marques a ti y a tu equipo por tener esas versiones de tu contenido en español latino eso está genial felicitaciones también a él que dobla tu voz se la rifa ojalá lo sigas haciendo está muy bien 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,finally  someone makes an android vs ios video
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,face_with_tears_of_joy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  of the time ios copy android rather than the opposite  dont get me wrong  iphone are amazing products  hardware wise  may be except by the battery and cameras  compared with androids  the problem imo is the os  just like macbooks are amazing laptops  but with a covoluted  os that lacks the most stupid simple features 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,congrats on the dub  lets go empire  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,here in our place  having an apple gadget is a  status symbol  its like almost everyones dream brand  lol 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when it comes to the updates support even though the latest ios is supported back  generations new iphone users look down upon the xr users
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when i saw the  ecosystem  as the last point  i was sure that the score would be brought to   and then the iphone would  win 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is by far the winner for me since    this comparison is also a bit unfair as it is like comparing tesla vs  all other electric cars in the world from all manufacturers 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i predicted every single point and the outcome as soon as i saw the categories 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i know you are in the us but also availability is a huge factor outside the us  i was a stock android user for a few years and always got google phones back since nexus  when i switched from iphone and never regretted it until two years ago when i was struggling to find google phones in spain  for some unknown reason  google has this policy that they do not release the phone on every market like apple does  i got really tired of chasing the google phone everywhere and switched back to iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the problem with these kinda debates or comparisons is that ios is used by one company  whereas android is used by hundreds of companies  most of the android versions you get on most android phones are heavily baked modified to fit their phone  so bit of a silly discussion really  if anything  its shocking that apple is able to win at any category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,facetime  i message  im good with viber and whatsapp 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is for durability and simplicity nothing else 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me customization its one of the biggest factors  because i get bored of my setups very often  also sideloading modded apps like revanced and so on is a must because i hate ads and will do everything in my power to get rid of ads everywhere  last thing is file browsing system because i like to set up and use folders and subfolders the exact way i like  thats why ive been samsung guy for a very long time  also  i like how he pointed out that the ecosystem works only in the us market because outside of the us  apple stuff is way way weaker
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what apps do you use that are seamless for a  phone user 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios period for me  most scammers will target android with virus apk file   cos its easy to install 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this was a fantastic tutorial  however  i need a phone that i could still connect to the network with in low signal areas and apple doesn’t cut it  android is the winner with that  thanks for the great breakdown 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,yeah but the apple ecosystem costs a ton of money  same as with their garbage tablets  pcs and laptops that get wasted in a couple of years
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i believe ease of use shouldve been android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think durability should be on that list it matters a lot to me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,back in the day  when i was a lil technology sprout i loved the freedom of customization android offered and still offers but as i grew older i realized that less is more and i just want the thing to w o r k hahah  i think apples approach to customization this last few years is perfect  its meaningful enough to offer some customization but not out there enough to have you accidentally make your device vulnerable for no reason  we hardly ever hear ppl talking about jail breaking the ios nowadays and i think thats great  for me  i just want to pick a nice pic for my lockscreen and background  select some useful widgets  maybe a nice font and thats it  nowadays the thing just needs to work properly and not fall appart on me  i cant afford having my device bricked or failing to do the shit i need it to do with my work schedule lmao 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,both are winners  you need to change that perspective i dint watch the video
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its not about being the  winner its all about taking part right   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,to be exact if u do this comparations living outside of europe and the us u will find android phones working better than iphones so if u can can u do a video about it pls   mkbhd
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its great to see that my knowledge isnt totally out of date now im an old  i always remember recommending iphone to less proficient technology users who just want stuff to work when they click the button  their priority is ease of use  apps and ecosystem  for familiarity and recognisability of apps and features  on the flip side i want customisation and features so ive always gone with android  sounds like that hasnt changed in the  or  years it has been since i felt the need to buy a new phone  or was asked to help someone else pick one 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in other words  apple’s about apple  whereas android’s about you   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what are the dimensions of your hand
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think that if youre already bought into a non apple eco system  so you already have a samsung laptop  dishwasher  and watch  for example  then eco system for you would have to go to android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this might sound ridiculous   i have an iphone and a flip and i feel the iphone is like a toyota it just keeps working so if i am buying a new phone every   years i had go for an iphone  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have been an android fan my whole life  however one of my most prominent hobbies is photography  i can’t stress enough that the color accuracy on iphones is a massive selling point  as much as i love android phones i can’t trust any photo that i edit on my galaxy phones  the screens tend to be over saturated  great for content consumption but terrible for content creation  for this reason alone i am basically forced to use an iphone  the day that samsung or google releases a flagship phone with  + color accuracy i’m going back to where my heart lives but until then islets iphone for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one cannot simply rely on ios  gotta have an android as secondary 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,let me put it this way  hundreds vs  apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,youtubers   shit we do not have content for next video  youtubers  android vs ios  xdddddddd kidding 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,remember the good old days with the nokia  and snake < good video bruv   d
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,most people use majority of the top apps  not sure how apple gets he award for it  same thing for ease of use and ecosystem  they are both exactly the same  you can get stock out of the box and use it without changes and it will be easy to use    if you are not tech savvy and you use non major branded android phone then you might struggle to tech support from your it family member because theyre not aware of feature x thats been implemented differently on the non major branded phone    also  the walled garden and lock in should be criteria  if you want choice  and not get locked into a design choice then android wins that category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the real winner is the friends we made along the way 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,used both platforms daily and have been a long time  since the early android days  g user  for me  apple emerges as the winner due to its longevity  top priority on security  emphasis on user privacy  consistent update support  optimization for speed  and most importantly  as a software developer for both platforms  an unparalleled ecosystem support  as a software developer  ios is by far the best with unmatched compatibility and support compared to android for devices  most of of team spends x longer fixing backward compatibility issues for older devices 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marcus please make a video comparing instagram or snapchat cameras of iphone and android  apparently  the stories and photos in these apps sucks on android when compared to apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the iphone is superior android is inferior
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphones are not worth it like your opinions
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,basically  iphone is for tech dumb people  and android is for tech savvy ones
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,fairphone  review plzzz  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i don’t like the fact that you have to put your iphone up to your laptop just to have a good camera on a call 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,let me put clear here     reason to get a device or os or whatever you want to call it  is not how much you can customize it  not who came out with things first   apps  is the   thing people use on any device    you can have a great phone but if the apps are shitty and not prioritized  it’s crap   same for support on your  k devices   i’m sorry but apple iphone ios wins it across all the board   which billionaire or multimillionaire or just normal busy person wants to deal with crappy apps  and no support if something goes wrong    i don’t have time to spend on customizing a phone   not even going to start if you have kids and the control you have over them 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the real winner is both of them cuz they get our money for their hot garbage  we as consumers always on the losing side 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i really thought he was going to give it all to the iphone with the android going down easily without a fight  but after watching and seeing the way he was so clinical about each specific factor  im actually impressed 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about someone still with a nokia windows lumia phone  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the most important thing  which is price hasnt been compared
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i cant imagine living without the convenience of cracked apps  third party applications  and the affordability of android devices  its all about embracing freedom  im sure ill enjoy apple devices but ill surely miss my freedom
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,splitscreen  pip 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my taste better than your taste  zomg
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,only apple fanboys are constantly talking about ecosystem  what is more ecosystem than pluging the phone into the computer and see and copy all files i want 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video   how do you personally use the iphone  is it for personal use vs business   marques
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps really doesnt go to the iphone  while in general they may be higher quality  there are countless categories of apps you simply can not get on the iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, key problems with ios in my opinion is when you are doing heavy duty processes the minute you switch to another app ios or ipados will kill the app  i dont know if apple resolved this with the m+ ipads  the second one is iphone not with usb c which should be resolved this year 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i ranked my most inportant features exactly the way you did lol def android for me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im an android guy  but the only thing i would want from apple is guided access  its a game changer for my kids  my wife uses hers all the time 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont quite get why apps went to apple  having experimented with app development  it is such a pain to get the most basic thing running on ios  apart from rediculous policies  fees  overall closeness of the system  for example  you have to develop on mac without a choice  and how they keep stealing and monopolizing apps
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro forgot to compare price to performance ratio he thinks every body is rich
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i like how he didnt mention repair even once in this video  one would think this would have a huge impact on what to chose 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its kind of mindblowing how closed minded people in organizing communicating roles are to regularly make use of closed  discriminating systems like imessage  facetime etc  for public communication  its like setting up a phone number that only works properly if you have t mobile  and everyone else has to use a literal telegram to communicate with them in morse code 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i bought the first iphone in   ever since  i get every alternate iphone and sell or gift the old  in parallel  i bought a few android phones as side phones  after  years on this journey  i recently gave my iphone  max pro to my parter  and i got a pixel  pro  until apple makes something as big as it did in   i believe i’ll not look back 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is an os iphone an phone  also thats google pixel with a modded android version  the os on iphone is called ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lol i thought you will totally results in a draw but you tried your very best to make sure they are soooooooozero~~~ close  frankly people fight over ios and android are just trying to pretend they are smart by choosing  the right side  logic doesnt apply here  unfortunately
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this video doest not mention that security and privacy are the most important  as we are everything in one phone   the winner is iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the iphone  pro max is the best phone out right now
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i feel you totally slipped over sideloading in the apps category  side loading is the main reason i use android  i barely use it but its saved my back a couple of times  to sideload on ios you have to jailbreak  for me missing sideloading is a huge issue 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have one year in since i switched my personal phone from android to ios and i am still baffled by the fact that you cant independently adjust volume for ringtone  media and alarms alerts  i lost count of how many times i almost had a heart attach in the morning when some alarms went off at top volume 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,winner for me is number  thanks 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,really  dude iphone still trying to catch up with android  just in the thousands of apps that are off the store that allows rooting the android as an open source os then the hardware  please stylus screens cameras  battery controls overall experience and adaptability of commercial apps are   better in android and non existent in iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,one thing you should remember giving excitement point is you are comparing one company with millions out there  you must have compared one company with apple thats where real justification does and when it happens  you know who wins  d
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it is time for a new os system than ios and android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,excitement should be a tie  when a new feature comes to android  you get excited when apples gonna copy that and vice versa
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i totally agree with this  with one specific remark  which of course is just my opinion  looking at android as a whole  picking out samsung specifically for their ecosytem is a bit wonky  androids strength is multiple manufacturers  but it also divides the platform  so the android ecosystem  not just samsungs   ends up weaker  although thats not really the correct terminology here  for me  personally  i like them both for exactly the reasons mentioned in this vid  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about price  that should be part of the analysis
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,price  screen quality  photo quality  batterylife  all kinda important as well  p  anyway  i have said this many times before  but ill say it again   official  updates matter far less on android phones  because they work differently  google sends important security updates through the play services platform  which happens for a period of time far longer than even apples iphone updates  apps get updated seperately  unlike on the iphone where  for instance  if your browser is out of date  youre out of luck because it only gets updated when the os itself is updated  so when important security updates get pushed to your device for a very long time and your apps always stay up to date  who cares which android version youre running  its not as important as people think  and then when you take pricing into consideration 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphones ui is just bad  literally the worst  for starters  when typing words  you cannot edit the word  the cursor cannot be moved between the alphabets of a word  you have to clear and type the word again  we indians most of the time type some native language words in english alphabets  iphone cannot learn these either  as compared to android in this regard  apple completely sucks  to go back in an app  you need to find the back button everytime in every different app  and the calulator is just worst  it does not even show the calculation you are performing  let alone the history of calculations performed  what is the use of calling this a smartphone  even the call logs are limited to the point that they are useless  and sharing data with others is a pain  even the share button needs to be rediscovered every time in every different app  anything apart from calling is designed to be difficult  i am seriously surprised how it can be this bad  when they have so much resources 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well shoot  i brought my pitchfork all this way for nothin 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this guys intro
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no one talks about battery on iphpnes  i have used iphone and battery problem is there  if you do heavy gaming like pubg and call of duty it drains faster and battery life goes down quickly and you start having lower battery life unless you pay more and get the new battery  this is not the case with android  enjoying these games on s plus easily and battery is still good 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple service in india is not good
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i picked up my android later than most and just knew how to use it  played with an i phone for a week and still found it weird
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,repairability and cost of thereof    very important  who in their right mind wants to by a single use phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,havent watch the video  and propably wont  but based of of the title  its not a comparison you can make  iphone  hardware  vs android  software  that like comparing pears to bananas  it should be iphone vs samsung or iphone vs sony or iphone vs anything other manufactura if its the hardware otherwise it should be ios vs android which is both software 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use should go to android  samsung has easy mode  aka grandma mode  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think apps shouldve went to android and excitement shouldve went to iphone  and generally android shouldve really won due to having so many different options of phones and  current year  price ranges  iphone is mcdonalds  consistent and reliable  android is moms cooking  varied and tailored to you 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,upadate support even though apple does it better its because they only have one version of ios whereas android have a bunch of them so idk it needs some context in that categorie
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android for me  all the way 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  marquess editor removing his homework folder
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,here in india i used my last phone which was an android nd it was pretty much like rs    dollars  which is pretty good for a phone  it started lagging after three software updates which the company promised me  it was a realme  pro  now  when i switched to iphone  plus  the app downloads  the contact transfers and the camera ai that makes the images look like its clicked on a dslr  i own one so i know the quality and the difference  i do miss the editing softwares that were on my android nd also the customizations that i used to make but still being the long lasting phone like ios  i prefer this over iphone cause all i need is to chick good professional looking photos and makes a phone call or watch reel nd chat on whatsapp 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is nice but always android for me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,here in brazil  an important factor to consider is pricing  prices of iphones have gone up to insane levels  even if one wants to stay with ios  one will have to think hard about whether it is really worth it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung has focus mode
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apples and oranges 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so  really pretty much the only reason why you could consider android superior would be a choice of different design  cheaper hardware for performance  obviously running shitware lmao even oneplus is androidshitware  oh also if you don’t admit android is shitware you don’t know what android is  honestly tho they’re both amazing  android is just annoying sometimes  just as much as apple each in their own way 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the way you categorized items is funny u just wanted the iphone to win on apps android is by far better  excitement  seriously is this even a catagory 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,app advantage should do to android  you cant install app that is not on the app store on ios thats like the iphone being handicapped
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nicely done with the weightings  love some things about the apple ecosystem  mostly around the hardware and integration  however  the telling me what i should use and how i should work is not on 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the curious thing is that every comparison are between oss  but android is available in so many brands that i would say that some points to android would go to ios if the comparison would be against specific phones models  also privacy would be a great category  xiaomi ads that are almost impossible to remove are really annoying 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  so apple apps are not bloatware   what bs
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android é ter liberdade 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,does ios have multiwindow or freeform window its a deal breaker ofc
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,pixel fold or samsung fold  which one you prefer 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios  vs android  apple vs samsung no more 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me  customization is the least important  the main things i care about are ease of use  ecosystem  updates and the ability to get my phone serviced easily when something goes wrong  for me  iphone does this  i’ve owned android before and i very much enjoyed it but i stick with iphone for the reasons listed  i want it to work perfectly out of the box without a lot of effort from myself  i want it to connect to all my other apple devices and i want consistent security updates since security and the safety of my data is something i’m often concerned about  i will say i don’t understand the need from some people to have imessage  i’d be okay whether i had that or not  as long as i can still text people what does it matter 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,will you do a review on  huawei mate pro 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is way to much customized  xiaomi for example has it own app installer that makes software more complex to implement with and more buggy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this is stupid comparison in so many ways
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why dont we talk about price   expandable memory  how many people can really afford a iphone  in india just for that  reason android is king
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps all run better on ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i own and use every apple product but iphone   i own snd use samsung phones  but little else   though  im looking to get a tab s ultra tablet   so  thats my personal position 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,+  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,not sure we are the winners regarding their prices   nope   not sure we are  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this video was transversal  like were exploring other areas of our personal use of androids and iphones  and these categories really vary from person to person  so theres no best os between these two  its up to you to decide
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hey marques can you talk about the desktop mode on the android  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its  and you still cant organize your own damn homescreen on ios  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,price should also be considered  android has an advantage in affordability of older devices  new or used  a   year old samsung flagship would cost two times cheaper than a   year old iphone here in ukraine
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im lucky enough to be able to use both regularly and back in   iphone was my favorite  but i have since gotten to the point where i cant stand to use ios for more than a few months before i switch back
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,missing price  variety  designs  practicality  which are all wins for android  but great video  and agree with it
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,betamax or vhs   who cares   whatabot humane    time to move forward
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,to be candid  ive been using an iphone for the past two years after using a huawei p pro for three years  one notable issue ive encountered with the iphone is that it doesnt quite serve as a  one stop solution  for all my needs  for instance  when i used my android phone for activities like skiing  i could easily export videos from my gopro and insta cameras and transfer them to an external ssd connected via usb c  all with just my phone  unfortunately  this isnt possible with the iphone   furthermore  ive noticed that some applications i relied on when i had my android phone are not available on the iphone  for instance  i used a transmission client application and a kodi remote control app called yatse  which i cant find equivalents for on the iphone  it seems that while the iphone works well for the majority of users as a phone  for people with specific needs like mine  it still lacks several essential features for which i cant find suitable alternatives  to fulfil all my needs i must be sure that i always carry a laptop with me    
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about dual app support  so  in app category  android should have taken the win  and also  some major aaps which are not basically used in us are also not supported in ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,my iphone typing doesn’t seem as good as my pixel   my only gripe 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i tried to use ios i cant get half of apps i need to do my job so how you can give ios point for apps  and ecosystem  take android phone and usb c and you can connect to anything  but ios are useless  so real result is  for apple vs  for android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this video is a mind game
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,imo apps should be a draw  many apps on ios you must buy  on android you can download from third parties and customise  not to mention root capabilities
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you could’ve added cost as a category  i think that was more important
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,mb  the decision is personal  also mbman_shrugging_light_skin_tone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,cmd + c  > cmd + v across devices is just something i cant give up  i use it multiple times a day  however i miss features and customization from android  the calendar specifically  holy coffee i want a decent calendar widget on ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,these two phones will battle it out in the next few months 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why would you evaluate  excitement  and not stuff like longevity  accessibility  value  my mind was blown away when i saw a visually impaired guy use an iphone  with its screen off   years ago   also for ecosystem  currently that samsung pass or account or wth is a mess but somehow works greatly  it connects to my tvs and watch and im not sure how i even did it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,since day  when it was nokia  n  named iphone killers  vs iphones  i went to symbian  nokia  sony  samsung  many others   because they had better cameras and bluetooth transfer and you could easily side load applications by just installing an_app sis  now an_app apk  without need for root or jailbreak iphone  those same features were inherited by android  iphones are expensive which is key factor that was missed in this review  cost buying ownership  you can get all android features with new   device  i never needed facetime by using many other alternatives  whatsapp  zoom  messenger  google voice  and so many others  so clear winner for me is android  samsung a g since jan  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i just want people to understand the iphone is never yours apple forces you to do what they want buy what they want used only they products and apps at the end make your phone slow not working properly so you be forced to change to the new one with the same feature same apps  oh my gosh and list keeps going but they are good phone for united states of america
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,man  title should be android vs ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well  weighted score does not work fairly for me  because personally im completely lost in iphones  i just do not understand how do they work  so i would give  ease of use  point to android   i would also like to hear about price comparison  because apple is beyond expensive  same as samsung  but there are less costly options on the market  and all of them from android side
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung find my network is actually a lot stronger than iphone  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its ios vs aandroid
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you are really good my friend 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"  customization  android   features  android   apps  apple  this is clearly apple     excitement  android  because android has many lines   brands  so each brand will definitely provide surprises   attractive offers    updates  apple  this is obvious  but samsung is trying to do their best  so well see    ease of use  android  i know there are a lot of advertisements for the android smartphone line  but it still sells well for the android market in indonesia because the price of the goods is relatively cheap  so whatever the condition of the android  as long as its cheap and can be used for communication   playing games  its okay    ecosystem  android  i know the ecosystem from apple is extraordinary  but not many indonesians want to buy all products from apple such as macbooks  ipads  imacs  aipods pro max  airtag  sometimes they only buy iphones but their laptops are windows  the winner is  android   personally  since i live in asia  indonesia  this is based on what i see  i apologize if we have a different pov but we only see apple as a luxury product on the other hand  android  samsung  xiaomi  oppo  vivo  realme  poco  pixel  etc  is an  affordable product or functional product  on average  people who buy apple products buy more iphones    thats why apple hasnt opened an apple store in indonesia  because apples appeal is only in the smartphone line  even though apple has a multitude of product lines that can be sold   on the other hand  for android  the purchasing power of indonesian people is still relatively low  which means  on average  people prefer cheaper smartphones with good performance  thats why there are many smartphones such as xiaomi  poco  oppo  vivo  iqoo  realme  offering low prices but it provides performance  especially in playing games  is quite good "
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you could have unified the app   updates category and added a price category instead which would have had android come out the winner  even in the us price is a huge factor in deciding whether to upgrade or not  the fact you can buy an android phone from   to   suits anyones budget 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i guess some beginner edited this video
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,support should not be just about software  hardware support and repairability should have been included as well  with a lot of android devices  getting an after market screen or a battery is pretty easy  cheap and it greatly increases the life of a device  for that has been key with all the devices i have owned  how easy and cost effective is it to fix a device  years or maybe  years after i have bought it  with apple devices  given their popularity and standards  it couldve been an easy victory in this regard  but their approach towards making this very thing difficult just baffles me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,choosing between iphones and androids  its like picking a favorite child   but heres the twistrolling_on_the_floor_laughingmobile_phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a shame that you didnt put repairibility as a category  apple and samsung are really hurting users on that front 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,from now on whenever someone says there is an objective winner  i’m just gonna slap this vid in their face  thank you for this mature video
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,should have considered pricing as a category and see how iphones sucks 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bruv buying a phone  its getting more complicated than getting married
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well being an app developer  i feel developing an app for ios is much better than android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in the  apps  section you forgot to mention that you can install any apps you want on the android devices while with apple youre limited to the app store  relevant when apple wants   of a subscription and a company cant offer the app outside of their app store  or in certain cases  it leads to censorship of social media apps 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,video idea  make a podcast  video call stream with an ios and android developers  some big hot shot in their field  and go through some points for this ios vs android thing in an interesting view from develop and maintain for apps point of view  ecosystem for devs  what each platform does to help its devs to build more 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps should be given to android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphones are more durable  reliable with very less glitches than android and runs for many years without slowing down like android mobiles 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,should be ios vs android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lets be honest  android phones are alot more willing when it comes to innovation  fingerprint  cameras etc  love the apple flip and fold or their fast charging just to prove my point  and apples echosystem is great if you love indoctrination  overpay and insane prises for extras  like their fast charges  ohhh no wait 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android has focus mode 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,real life scientific analysis on the fly here  go marques  i am a happy researcher seeing this and knowing that you making this video would induce the general population more and more towards scientific reasoning 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ecosystem   regardless of where you’re located  android dominant or apple  the win probably still goes to apple  the video compares apple to samsung  but samsung is just one part of android  check the ecosystem of other brands and it’s not as good as samsung’s  compring whatsapp  messenger and imessage still falls under apps since ecosystem relates to continuity and connection between phone  laptop  stationary computer  watch  etc 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,fix file manager type c charging so one cable for all devices fast charging  the day this happens i am moving to iphone asap
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,features should go to the iphone as well  android has a lot of gimmick features but a lot of them are useless and not work perfectly as iphones  even if the face unlock is not secure  ar doesnt work on android smoothly as the iphone  also you should add category as resell market 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,huawei and honor have good ecosystem
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,would like you to get the hands on review on huawei mate  pro 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for my room mate  expansion  he likes being able to add a micro sd card  which you cant do with a iphone  or even some android phones  as for me  im kind of neutral  i mostly use spotify  and check facebook 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use includes accessories for me too  like for example a simple headphone can be plugged into a jack input on an android  that was basically the main reason for choosing the phone i got  its sad to see it is dying out 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,none of my friends use imessage and face time here im europe  lol  idk about the us
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use for iphone   no smart dial  no one button for back  no text prediction  at least in polish  settings for app hidden in general settings  are you joking  this was true  years ago  now andorid is waaaaay ahead 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ease of use  apple  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,from a android user  iphones are definitely better  but depending on user preferences n habits  android simply suits me more 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,basically when you say ios vs android you compare one single apple phone to a whole world of different devices which can give you a completely opposite expeirence despite having same android onboard  and its not just about visual aesthetics and camera setups  they all try to be unique and tweak android massively even in basic things like gestures 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,these categories  customization  features and excitement  died so fast that it wont last long until the next new phone model come out  clearly if i put a weight to each category  all these  categories would not greater than     so  i know exacting what i really want  anyway  thanks for the video for those still have issue choosing their right one 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i swear  google photos is the one that really sold android for me  having access to all my photos in whatever device available is great  i even have google photos in my ipad because all my photos are in google photos  you could just login to your gmail and access all your photos  google drive documents  keep notes  docs and spreadsheet  all in any browser you have in whatever computers available  let every app be a web base app 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,"for customization  something that i always didnt like about ios was app notifcation sounds   unless if the developer of said app built in the ability to change the notification sounds to something custom  you absolutely cannot do this on ios  you only get the basic tri tone or other basic  apple sounds   of course  this is excluding jailbreaks  which obviously isnt for everyone and comes with concerning risks in and of itself "
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ecosystem i agree with ios but samsung is improving a lot in it  samsung products are more like fridge tv  etc if samsung eco system is smooth enough with all their products damn sure it will be number 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,appreciation to winners 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, the answer is here 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ngl even as an ios user here  i feel like totally skipping over the fact that you can side load apps on android is taking a major pro of that platform away from it
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, vs   nice match 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,a better video quality in a pixel will seriously end this debate 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,boss no camera   iphone is the winner for me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,multitasking and a  real  file management system is what still keeps me on android  an example  for rendering a video with the app  splice  i have to   keep the screen on and   the app in the foreground with apple  on android  rendering a k vid for an our while making a call  watching videos on yt and texting on slack is no problem  i can attach a harddrive to my phone  can use it as a computer with any tv in any hotel room etc  android can be a workhorse while ios is for consumption  and this is no apple basing   i love my macbook  my mac mini and my ipad  it´s just that the iphone is overpriced af for its capabilities  and then there´s a dedicated standardized back button  what a guesture mess on an iphone but i disgress 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its tricky to compare a phone brand with an os brand 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what about costs as a factor 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dude   i did move to iphone last year and really i couldnt keep up with this shitty af os named ios  honestly there are tons of little annoying things that ios does that really effects the usability for one who used android for whole of his life  like   the absence of a universal back button  and   not being able to download or run stuffs in background  seriously dude its a shame a flagship phone in  cant even send like  whatsapp photos in background the moment you go back to home it stops sending photos      lack of customization   the lack of a proper file system    the notifications are a mess in ios  in a android you basically can choose which type of notifications you wish to get from a specific app  e g you can opt to receive only important notifications from amazon and choose to block all their promotional and spam notifications but in ios you will either get all the notifications or none   also you cant call record in ios   and for some weird reason ios only stores record of last  calls only  like really   whats the need of this stupid limitation   i can list many more but enough of rant for today   because of these reasons  last month i sold my iphone pro max and got a s ultra only after  month of using it  and honestly cant stop myself but to adore how good of a phone su is   i would never get a iphone again atleast not for next   years 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,updates    ease of use    apps    features    ecosystem    customization    excitement   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,focus mode is available on android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ok man
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have to contradict your statement of app development  as a developer from europe  i can tell that here android app updates are always prioritized over iphone app updates  first of all  there are more android users than iphone users  and secondly   ask any developer about the release process for android vs iphone  in google play  it is so much easier and fluent  while for appstore  it is a nightmare  there are so many hurdles  rules  checks  validations  and you have no guarantee how long it will take  if you are targeting a specific release date  for android its easy to achieve  for iphone  it is impossible 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,did you check on the fairphone  the fairphone  from  will get updates til   the fairphone   coming on the th of september  will get  years of software updates 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,is update support really better on ios when i wont get app updates for lets say my browser or something  id gladly take android in that section  as a yo operating system isnt and issue if i have my apps up to date  but the other way around is actually worse
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,all that is quite true  but lemme say this  iphone accessories is more expensive  even for rd party brand  they knew ios user would pay extra even thought its the same thing  im talking about a simple cable  casing  mount  adapter  etc  iphone is expensive because the build and features are better  sure whatever  but a phone case too  come on   ripping off user because of a brand  is not a good brand 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i knew you would choose apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what i noticed of using both android and iphones   the customization is fun for the first few months after that you really dont use it anymore
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,update supports that force update and purposely slow down your phone if its not the latest one goes to apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,things one could have added is    service   repairability   accessories   rd party ecosystem   security   data privacy   for me the biggest apple usp is how great and long lasting the experience is throughout various devices  macbook  iphone  airpods  apple tv  homepods  i am trapped in the golden cage but damn its comfortable
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,freedom is the category that i most value in a phone  guess which system im on 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so many reposts of this video everywhere
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,and the customization point alone is why i never bought an apple  the fact that we used to have to jailbreak an ipod jus to add custom lock screens was enough to keep me on andriod 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple for cheating in phone games android for actually playing phone games 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in my opinion its a base less comparison because mkbhd comparing one   mobile company  with   os 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, _i personally like both _  but iphone is now out of my reach as im low on the budget
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,personally  i feel that ease of use is objective if you live in a country where the majority of smartphone users use an android then it would actually be easier  for you  to use   im a programmer and id rather prefer a phone that is open source and literally has a perfect file management system i feel samsung is catching up very quickly in the ecosystem category as well
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,cost   affordability shouldve been an option too 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android phone with apple watch  end of discussion 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,red_heart 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you deserve everything you the best i got both i’m no  in australia spent over  on tech of my own money
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,perfect

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  what happens here 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,never owned an iphone and never will  i will never get the big deal with iphones  not saying they are bad phones  but never stuck with how apple tends to think of their customers as dumb and never giving them the full experience  only what they think you need
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,honest samsung wins over ipad
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love you marcus please ipad no real tex no phone call and tex on ipad on samsung tab yes how long will it take apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,mkbhd casually leaking the iphone  and no one noticing the difference 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,comparing android and ios is a lie  i found one ui > pixel ui > colour os  etc    and everyone has their own openion   so comparing android vs ios mostly makes no sense 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,add user repairability or you are biased to apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the world would have been same without this video  this video is literally all over youtube since  years  why was this even needed 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think hes missed a big point about the apps  the apps that are not available in the app store 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,    and the last category is ecosystem 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,and value for the money  totally android in most cases 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hands down this is the best video ever made when it comes to ios vs android and should be sent to anyone when an argument starts   this should be the video that ends this war between apple fanatics and android fanatics 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it the cellphone world was christianity  then iphone would be catholicism and android would be non denominational  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think just get both phones if you can  i recommend google pixel for android and iphonepromax for ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wrong title   its ios vs android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,only apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  fun fact my elderly parents hate apple and love android for the ease of use   apps suck  what developers dont tell you that that developing for ios costs money while for android is not  so if we talk about not us than android is better and dont forget that apple is not in every country  but i bet that there are at least  android phone seller    ecosystem sucks  because it takes away the freedom  if mentioned samsung  so mention that galaxy buds will work with every other phone as well as watch  while apple stuff is very poorly work with android  meaning that walls around the eco also a dealbreaker for me  and killer feature is connect your phone via usb to any freaking thing on a planet  if saved my performance multiple times   actually theres a very very simple question that you need to ask to choose apple or andoird  ecosystem  if you have windows computer  sony headphones  galaxy watch  and god knows what else  you are out of your mind if you are getting apple  so it just comes down to ecosystem and that it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,google can sell the best product but unless they start respecting privacy i choose apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i disagree with apps being better on ios  i have a few friends with iphones and there were so so many times when i discovered super awesome and powerful apps on android and those were not present on ios or were added years later  so no  in my opinion the app variety its not better on android  also  you forgot to mention the fact that you can install modded apps on android  you have instagram  spotify  youtube  and many more  modded apps that add a ton of functionality and fix any  issues  you might have had with the stock apps 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the title is wrong  iphone is well  a phone  and android is an operating system  you should have known better dont compare a phone with an operating system  ios vs android  the real winner 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i use both occasionally but prefer iphone  because of the camera system  hdr capabilities  and the fact that   times things just work from the beginning  in my experience  android is for tinkerers because of the so called freedom to customize and such  things often dont work and i have to seek solutions  its a brain sharpening excercise  also  my customization experience is that one can spend hours trying to find a nice looking alternative launcher  fonts  icons etc  and then revert to the default anyway because all alternatives are not complete and i can navigate into a corner where the look is crap  there are too many half baked options available and it takes endless hours to sift them through  in ios  most customization decisions are made instead of me  and i just use them without wasting time 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i really really loved your ending  you make a solid point  im team android   but i respect your point of view because you make really solid statements about each 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,on apps quality is important  but the quantity aspect isnt as much a negative  android is far more open to sideloading and being open with apps  so you can find a lot more freedom there  this also ties into the ecosystem for android being more open to small developers and niche products  its a blessing and a curse  but my htc one as an example has an ir transmitter  which i can use with certain apps to control a tv or anything that uses ir signals  not many phones come with that capability  so an app for it doesnt make much sense in the grand scheme of things  but certainly for not paying a hotel extra for the ac  you cant hold the quantity aspect against it without the variety part  with the frameworks provided it also isnt that big a deal to update apps for multiple phones outside of some fringe resolutions or something  in the end those things are less about the operating systems and more about individual hardware and mainstream phones tend to all be the same  foldable and other fringe stuff doesnt exist in large enough quantities to be a big concern for most developers 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the mkbhd video got really boring  as tech tember rolls in  you can already forsee the script for every review  with a quirky intro  speech about features  photo of a dog  photo of a car in the lot  final thoughts  end 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,idk if this counts in the apps category  but i use a handful amount of apks to make my phone experience better 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i love deeply customizing my phone  so iphone has always been a no go for me  id maybe get an ipad  but i like my tablet to be more of a computer vs a giant phone  so i go for the surface in that category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,airdrop needs to improve reliability   i have had to restart phones more times than i like to get airdrop to work 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,from an ease of use side of things i actually completely disagree  when picking up and navigating the phones i find the iphone to be sooooo unintuitive  but thats also a super subjective thing   edit  the main problem you didnt mention with the  ecosystem  category and should reverse the result even on your own logic is that the  apple ecosystem  only works if everything you own is apple  as soon as apple products start needing to cross over with other technologies it becomes a mess  where as any android ecosystem will pretty much integrate with any other android product pretty seamlessly 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you are in jail with apple ecosystem  facetime and imessage are overrated to me  i just dont see the big deal in using them at all  people getting over excited the blue bubble   unless if you can still jailbreak iphone these days  theyre boring to me  the only thing that i like on iphones more than the android is the way notifications are on their lock screen
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me its android for phones but mac for laptop  i wouldnt use an iphone if you gave me one for free nor a windows laptop  every day is a living synchronization hell   pray for mojo
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,imo  people are more excited about the upcoming iphone in general  the rumours begin to pop up for the next iphone from october itself  almost every week there is a new rumour about iphones apple and lets not talk about the lines outside the apple store when the new iphone launches  its september now and we have few rumours about s and as of now we have a lot more rumours about iphone  already   yes  androids do have a lot of diversity but that doesnt mean its more exciting 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,is video me aisa kya hai ki  din me  lakh views hai
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think the video misses several important things  first of all  i dont know about us but in other countries in asia and specifically in india no one  uses facetime  imessages etc  apps even if they have an iphone  even abandoned apps like google duo is used more than facetime    secondly  there has to be a definite category of  price  at least   of the world population will keep this as their first priority  even if you give a very functionally advanced iphone  or samsung galaxy ultra models  many will just not buy it for the price alone  as at the end of the day it is just a phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me android is more value for money for the freedom it gives and the handy features they provide  yes it was crappy before but now its pretty good  man the freedom  storage  form size  fast charging  hz is cheap are what keep me hooked  the new form factor of iphones is uncomfortable and big naah for me 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,kind of surprising that you missed a category that seemingly would be at the top of most peoples lists 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,last time i had to use iphone for work  i couldnt add an attachment to an email by browsing the file manager  have they fixed this 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,longevity and price wise  iphone obviously wins 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,highly disagree with ease of use on the iphone  repairs are also very easy with android phones compared to the past  with iphone its almost never practical to repair the phone unless its a battery replacement and you are never guaranteed data recovery  this is absolutely stupid    times youll walk out of there with a bill higher than the cost of a new iphone  at this point theyre less of service centres and more of just shops  they have more shops period   ease of use  dont make me laugh  there are so many miniscule frustrations with the iphone if youre not already in an apple ecosystem  the incredibly poor bluetooth implementation for one  just moving files off your iphone is tedious  how it pushes icloud and annoys you to the max from day   omg your gb is up  delve into settings and turn it off and lose everything  changing ringtones is difficult  sometimes your phone rings and you have no clue why it doesnt ring  is the switch on   is the volume low   dont even get me started on the dialer  have you even used the dialer   theres no support for numpad search dialing  you have to manually search your contacts which is such a weird  step process to have  you cant call recents with a different sim  you have to search it up again in your contacts or manually put in the number if not stored  and dial it with a different sim   there are so many tiny things  im sure people can come up with s  some of these you absolutely cant do anything about even with rd party apps due to how limited the os is 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple has the best out of pocket camera  but thats it haha
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,focus mode on ios is the same thing as routines on android  right  no 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its amazing how your videos are so understandable to just about everyone  and your knowledge is so immense but yet you find a very unique way to make sure that just about every viewer understands exactly what youre saying   even if theyre not text savvy at all  one an amazing young man and an amazing channel which i enjoy every single time you put out something new 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro never heard of modded apps in android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think youtubers are among the only ones who give an f about  customizability  speed  camera  and quality are what people want  when they cant afford that  they just get android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,really ease of use to iphone  case in example india  china and far east  do you know the amount of first time not techy people from young to old and rich to poor and people who are using a phone for first time using android  the penetration of digital life in these countries is far deeper than usa or europe 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,love love love the presentation and the conclusion part of the the video but  i kept wondering  why is there no camera category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,intro song name please please 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,spoiler   min of video for no real conclusion  just chose the one you are biased to 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no points guessing which way i go 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the new fairphone looks like itll have even better updates
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,put your pitchforks down 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as someone who has  numbers and  phones  one is samsung and the other is iphone  i can’t agree more with this video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android is customizable  apple is customized   its why there is no ugly apple user interface   while androids is pretty much ugly most of the time 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wont go to ios as they dont have the apps 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i was an iphone proponent for the longest time  i had an iphone gs  s      and then my last was the s which i kept until   where apple lost me as a consumer was the removal of the headphone jack  but the constant updates kept me on ios even though i wasnt into the rest of their products  especially mac os  bc i simply dont like it at all  when i started to notice my s slowing down  i made the jump to android with the galaxy s+ since oneui looked like a great blend of ios and android  it felt weird for about a week  but i fell in love with the freedom it gave me to do basically whatever i wanted  i always thought that ease of use was super important  but being someone who was into building custom pcs  this stopped making sense when i ran into problems sideloading apps on ios  i naively believed samsung wouldnt follow apples decision to drop the headphone jack due to their marketing at the time  but i quickly realized it wasnt that big of a deal  then i made the decision to try the z fold   as i felt folding phones had matured enough  and i loved the flexibility  no pun intended lol  the z fold  resolved a lot of my complaints about the  as well  the  was disappointing though  if you have any sort of technical troubleshooting ability and are curious about android  i highly recommend samsung phones  they even have an easy mode that gives a very ios like experience  you can also get great trade in values for your phones using some workarounds so you dont pay anywhere near flagship prices  and even keep your old phone should you not like the new one and want to return it within the time period given  basically  find the highest trade in value android phones  search for some used ones at a price much lower than the offered value  and boom  profit  the only downside is resale value  because people simply dont value older android phones that much  hence why my workaround is viable  samsungs smart switch makes the transfer from ios super simple  but you will not get everything like paid apps  sorry   google opinion rewards is a great way to avoid paying for any apps since they pay you for answering simple surveys  if you have any questions about moving from ios to android  just ask 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone is the best phone   to communicate with othner apple devices 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,also expandability and price should have been a category  how could you not mention price 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im likely weird on this  but the lack of customization was a plus when i switched from android to iphone  i was deep in the android customizing rabbit hole  custom roms and kernel tweaking and everything  i spent tons of time adjusting my phones  trying to get it exactly perfect only to dump it all and start fresh a week later because something new dropped  i never felt fully satisfied because there was so much to try  i never really used my phone that much  i just messed with it   then i tried out an iphone  figured out the os  tweaked a few settings  and i was good  it didnt bother me that i couldnt adjust every minute detail to fit my liking  i actually do stuff with this phone  it isnt an unfinished project that ive yet to make use of as a smartphone    so yeah  people with control issues might find that useful 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,features   android quality   iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,yea i skipped to the very end knowing what hell say 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the ecosystem section was highly biased towards the usa how come you didnt include the cost of that ecosystem  that is extremely important to many people winner android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i still buy samsung  cant stnd iphone
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, maybe you care a lot about ecosystem  and maybe nothing else  dead on for apple users 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,to me the no go with android is that you have to have a google account so they track my every action to sell my data 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,absolutely superb content and the overall script is chefs kiss
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,excitement is a weird category to have  or at least your use of it  you just compared new features coming to multiple different phones to a single companys phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,app sideloading should automatically give the app win to android imo
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the openness  open innovation  customizability about android keeps me in its ecosystem  i also like it because of the fact that they dont force you to stay in their ecosystem 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the real winner is us  because we get cool shit
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive been an android user since galaxy s and using the iphone  made me switch to ios  i just want a lasting phone  then the ecosystem of apple is just brilliant specially with the family and the security is just top tier  the one thing i hated with android were the apps  they just want access to everything and you cant turn it off  you just cant download if you wont accept  that was way back then but now super happy with the iphone  pro and its so much better with the family having all iphones
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i just want my phone works out of the box  all apps are well supported  and lasts as long as possible  there are already too many shits on linux that i have to setup install update tune customize  i dont want to deal with unnecessary problems on my phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’ve sometimes found that on android phones there can be more features but said features aren’t that useful like it’s there for the sake of saying it is but past the moment of novelty discovery of the thing  you don’t really use it and therefor   need it  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,save yourself  minutes and just choose the phone that you feel comfortable using  very simple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well i can use android  in a  phone and i am pretty sure i can do same for android  and 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the winner is the one that has the apps you own available on it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im curious how iphone works for linux users  is it even possible to use an iphone and only linux as a computer 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,anything apple stresses me out  ease of use is definitely not best on iphones nor macs 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what a cool video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the ending of this video is why mkbhd stands out from everyone else  i thought i saw it coming but then i didnt see it coming 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,there should be room to factor in things you just cant tolerate in either of them  like planned obsolescence  ease of repairs  right to repair  etc 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the lighting and quality of this video are amazing  i was listening but when i glanced for a second i wanted to stay and watch
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,youre wrong about ease of use  they both get a point  they both have phone icons on the home screen  message apps  app stores  camera icon looks like a camera  you stab your finger at an icon to open it  as far as basic use  theyre both the same 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,only one i disagree with is apps  so far  and only because the crux of the point is  people prioritize updating apple apps  which is just a cliff note of the previous point  id say the fact that  theres an app for that  as a concept for android far out ways the developers preference of updating efficiency  apps are all about ability of use  and android smashes apple in that regard 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if android had imessage  id get an android  but they dont
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,very fair video overall  but i dont agree with the apps section because thats an incomplete picture  i can concede that the quality of tier  apps would be better on apple  but the ability for me to sideload apps and use alternative app stores is huge  on android  im able to install sideload apps or specific versions of apps if i so choose   even without googles blessing  i cant do that on apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,plz unbox sony xperia  v
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,id argue that an aspect of the apps category that was missed is the level of integration third party apps can have  this is partly a crossover with the customisation category  with the ability to change the default dialler  sms app  navigation app  etc  but also the ability for apps to integrate with each other  when an iphone user saw for example the way that calls  texts and media playback are integrated into google maps navigation on android  they were very impressed  i imagine there are other similar examples 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apk apps left the chats 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you value security updates and want a phone that gets new features after you buy it and dont advertise it as a  feature  like they are gifting you this amazing feature  without the need fiddle with the device and os yourself from questionable sources  ios wins hands down  i cant use a device thats not being patched    reason i use ios over android  apps for tablet and fold devices in the android ecosystem are typically phone apps scaled vs dedicated tablet apps for ios and so many apps in ios made for android work better on ios  smoother  i dislike the bloat in android  similar to windows  i realise you can remove it  but i shouldn’t need to  ask me if i want it and when i say no  thats it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,were the background colors on purpose to foreshadow the end results  if so then i applaud you and your team
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,your choice of music in video is dope 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bro  just try to just send a file  if you can see your files xd  out of an iphone  that shit is useless
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i often found out that i had features on my android because my apple friends started bragging about them  apples definitely better at marketing but its the way apple people act about their devices  i work heavily with macs and people always ask me what i like better  if you work with technology you usually end up hating both on some level  at least when youre troubleshooting 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,neat 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, dont recommend this channel 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dude compare one ui with ios
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i knew he was going to give it to iphone lmao  ur an iphone maxxy  omg  im not surprised
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,repairability is an important aspect that i think should have been included  apple devices are ridiculous when it comes to repairs  we drop our phones every now and then and this bit is quite important 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, minutes to hear   youre the winner  i get it  it pushes the phone makers to be better  but what about the people who came here to find there answer  the ones that have to only pick one every year or so  the ones that cant afford to switch for some time  its probably a niche group of viewers  but i think the video should have been geared more towards them  more towards the unsure  just an opinion  as all other comments  idk
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,itunes is bloatware itself
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,perfect video i am so apple and i agree with you i care the most about ease of use and updates then ecosystem  the rest i dont care about
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,someone might have already mentioned this  but im gonna give a big biiig disagreement to the  ease of use part  as someone who has used both oss  worked in phone retail  selling and helping out with support   i know first hand how god awful apple is when you have fed yourself  forget one password  and dont have access to another decice or have another email registered with apples system already   ups sorry  you have to recover the whole phone and delete all  now  considering how many older people use iphones because family says itll be easier for us to help you  and oh iphone is so easy to use  yes  it is  if you are younger  understand phones and tech better  have other devices  and have been around the block before  or are into their ecosystem in a bigger way then many are    with android  you have most likely been promted to set up  two factor id  earlier  but apple counts on you having a second apple device as the  first choice  which is so arrogant  or  you might be able to make a new password just by creating a new email and use that as the  new password reciever email  when faced with this problem with android    iphones are easy to use if you know what you are doing  so you know not to fuck that one specific thing up  their obsessive need for  password remembrence is anti consumer  for all consumers that arent as well adept  it is so god damn hard  to only own one apple device  and they capitalize on that    hope you read this small rant and maybe it breathes some thought into this whole topic  love your videoes  keep it up   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nice vid 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,pretty amazed that price didn’t come in to account with this comparison  for a lot of people it’s a major factor in choosing what ecosystem is right for them

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple continues to update all phones to keep slowing your phone till you have to upgrade
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im an android user but i would call this one a tie 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think its really important that he pointed out that this is from america  outside of the us and europe android has a much larger market share  and that comes down to the hardware and ecosystem  usb is huge  but also so many more hardware options  iphones in general are more expensive  but there are some very cheap android phones out there  its going to be the only thing you can afford if you lack cash  changing sims or having multiple sim cards is very important too  expandable memory  and so on 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,mkbhd videos like this never fails  keeps getting better each and every day

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i was an iphone user until the samsung s came out  then i wanted to see what it was like on the other side  i love the customization and now feel like i am in a prison when using an iphone  i can make the phone look and behave the way i want it to  not how some engineer in cupertino wants it to act and look like  updates  never had any issues  speed and fluency  my su is a beast  no lag  the screen is awesome  it has usb c and i will not have to buy proprietary cables like i would with this years iphone  i can text my iphone friends just the same  heck  if i want a blue bubble i can make it that color  at least on my end  iphone users cant  lol  i can use any default app i want and not tied to apples map app or any other app  there are plenty of great apps on the google play store  i even use more spen more then i thought i would and happy its there  some of these iphone users make up stuff  lol  the reality is that both iphone and my samsung phones are both great devices  but i just prefer my samsung  looking forward to upgrading in february to the su  i do find it interesting that the author of this video  whom i love and subscribed to  uses an android as his main driver yet on another video sides more with ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,thanks for the great sharing  how about photo quality and privacy protection 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,as a flutter app developer who develops apps for both android and ios  development of app for ios has been the most painful thing  also  having no mac means no developing of app for ios  also factor in the strict policies and compulsory using of apple of in app purchases with   payment cut  development app for ios is easily worse than development for android by all means

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you argue apple stores are everywhere  that’s in the us  there are people on this earth who would have to literally fly thousands of kilometers to their next apple store  so if your looking at this conversation from an american viewpoint it’s just unnecessary because everyone uses imessage and you have to have an iphone  if you’re speaking worldwide  the service point isn’t correct
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the reason i prefer android is mostly because it doesnt force you to stay within its ecosystem  like  i can use samsungs dex on any other windows laptop  also  i think in android this ecosystem aspect is not much glorified as it is ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,something that was forgotten about apps is third party downloads  android can get free versions of many apps as well as apps not made for your phone  such as ad free youtube or the impressive camera app from the pixel
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,these videos never help anyone so let me give you a direct answer  everything ios can do  android can do as well but there are soo many things that ios cannot do that android can so yeah we all know which os is better

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,can we just mention two great android features that rarely get the shout out they deserve    a back button     when calling someone or texting  you just start typing on the number keypad using the  letters associated with each number  good ol t texting  and it brings up the associated contacts  no need to go into your contacts app  it drives me nuts that i cant do this on my work iphone   love my samsung

nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this video in a nutshell  android = quantity  apple = quality 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this entire video and all like it are completely moot  i thought we would be beyond these types of videos by this point  especially coming from mkbhd  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,not going to talk about costs or is that obvious
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone ease of use  lol no  thats totally biased  even non customized android is better than ipone  prime example of iphone being worse  cant find camera setting in the camera app itself  and some other app too  dont forget about transfer file between platform  and many more things that iphone cant do   and one more thing  this video is totally biased to apple  i mean just look at the categories  software update and app should have included in one category only  the software   ecosystem  please just stop with that stupid category  the world doesnt consist of american only 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why do we feel the  need  for there to be a winner neither of them  care  about us   nether is free we dont have these debates about our fridges  microwaves   sofas god knows they do a helluva lot more for us than our phones the reviewers carry   use both cause its the wise business choice its us the less fortunate who fight over this childish idea
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if apple would just fix imessage  i wouldnt care what phone people use   but when someone sends me a image that looks like it was taken on a   megapixel digital camera from the s  or a vertical video that maximizes to the size of a postage stamp in the middle of my screen and is as pixelated as a japanese adult video  i know they sent it from that fkn broken imessage app on their crapple phone   fix yo sh t apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,he added excitement category so its not a landlside win for apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its important to remember that the choice between iphone and android is highly subjective and depends on individual preferences and priorities  some people prefer the iphone for its seamless integration with the apple ecosystem  while others prefer android for its customization options and wide range of hardware choices  there is no definitive  real winner  as both platforms have their strengths and weaknesses  and whats best for one person may not be the same for another  great video 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,sure  ios didn’t get copy and paste until version   but it was the best implementation and everyone copied them  remember android’s first implementation  absolutely garbage fire 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,why is price not a category here   seems like the most important one
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot the most important feature the after purchase support  apple has by far the best tech support for any requests  thay have the best support and customer care  they treat you really like a person not a number 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,first time viewer and i must say i am impressed  this guy speaks eloquently and gives a very nuanced and intelligent presentation 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have both and have had for several years   both have their benefits but if i had to choose just one i’m taking the iphone   security  updates  and seamless integration is a much bigger priority to me than being able to install a spongebob squarepants theme   another thing marques didn’t really touch on is customer service   if i have an issue apple is extremely good about taking care of it and making whatever issue i may have right   in the android world that really doesn’t exist   trying to get samsung to repair something or honor their warranty is an absolute nightmare   eventually you might get it done but you’ll have to jump through a ridiculous amount of hoops just getting there 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i like a good phone that is not crazy expensive  hence i buy a pixel a  it does everything i need at less than   the price of an apple phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios all the way
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in us and europe and australia ios makes sense but in rest of the world its android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the real winner   linux  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,disagreement with the ease of use verdict  if someone wants android to be the simplest they can customise it for themselves or get help from someone to do it one time   i customised my dads android in a way that he can use his phone without being attentive    the clear fact is that you are biased but pretending to be unbiased 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i was waiting for the   and the winner  the winner is you 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,what i love about android is that it is not closed off to other os  like if you have a samsung tv  it will easily let you cast stuff from you apple phone  if you are switching from an apple to an android phone  all your stuff is easily transferable  but its the other way around that its usually a nightmare  trying to pair non apple stuff with apple is harder  screen mirroring is harder  file sharing is harder  apple just wants you to use their stuff or leave and that is something that is completely the opposite of androind and i just love that abput android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,that intro is wayyyy too loud
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,nobody use imessage outside of usa   whatsapp is the world standard
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont use   of features of my iphone    of people dont  even the ones that say they do still dont 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i get more excited about android phone releases because they are always taking chances with new and interesting features  apple does this but on a much smaller scale  i say this as an ios user  the nerd in me wants to see a lot of specs and tech being pushed to its limits but i like my phone to just work  everytime  i never found that to be my experience with android phones 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,value for money is also a factor  most people buy iphones not because of ecosystems or features but to show off 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in my opinion  android is a better phone  os than the iphone ios but the iphone has a better security system hands down 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im back to android from over a decade of iphones  the main reason  price  in my country you pay over  us dollars for a new iphone   so i got a pixel  renewed under   iphone  was  in the same conditions  i thought that i was to feel off the grid going back to android but im quite happy  i still think that for the same price if you get it an iphone is the superior device  but the price is too much at least arround here 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,  what phone is it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,is the asus zenfone  now your daily driver 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for  percent of people this comparison is not important we dont have   to pay for iphones  then we will buy a   android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,last year i got an iphone as a birthday gift   weeks in  i sold it and bought a samsung
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,another major benefit to the android is how easy you can transfer files across devices offline  you just plug and play  it is not that simple to transfer files in the apple ecosystem without the internet 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,does any ever thiunk there will be a day they will join together to make a super company for all of this 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,how can you do a comparison like this and not mention the privacy of my data  how much am i sharing with the os vendor  does the vendor make money on my data or just takes care of it for me  to what extent does the os put me in control of what’s shared with the apps 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,base line men is your phone what  the real base  is the ecosystem you use more and purpose of your phone  android or apple doesnt mader is purpose  of use
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,bruh for apps android is winner u can even patch instagram or most apps so that no adds come ease of use etc  also without roots and without installing rd party apps  also there are a lost of apps not on plastered and open source which are very usefull
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,broo why you hava a biff with ios   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,love the vid but the green screen reflecting on your face was distracting
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i like both systems   but my daily is an android samsung 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i think ease of use is a very subjective thing  and an important aspect of it also comes down to which platform you started with  i know a lot of people who find ios extremely complicated to use once they shift from android  i am sure it will be the same case for android  there are stuffs that make both ios and android easy and hard to use  and it all depends on what you are working with  so i dont think ease of use being so much of a subjective thing deserves equal weightage to something as objective as lets say customization 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have both s ultra and iphone  but for using it for business like uber driver i choose android because it more smart less effort and super fast
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple just rips their customers off  especially when it comes to things like their accessories  for example take a look at the samsung tabs which always includes a s pen in the box compared to apple who just makes it a nightmare for the users as their version  apple pencil  needs to be purchased separately 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple is charging more for their brand value  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,make a vid on apple ecosystem pls
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,to be honest im not surprised he chose apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android it is
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i used to hate on the iphone for being overpriced   it still is  but id like to try one when the  pro max comes out  the only way to know which one is for me is to try it myself 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,could i just put an iphones battery in my android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i can’t believe price value wasn’t a category  this is why marques is fun to watch but i never take his advice seriously  the guy never talks about value or price because he gets most of his tech free and he’s rich so it doesn’t matter  this is the opposite for your average consumers 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i phone just does it right it’s so simplistic and easy to use   i still have one with a button so as for the new ones i really can’t say button is literally what makes it easy
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,it’s not even fair the amount of features that are missing from apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i will never understand why ppl defend either phone like they have some blood pact with each company  theyre telephones for crying out loud 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the green text gonna  be a no for me dawg
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apps are better on iphones  really  there are more apps because theres more access to apps on what they can do  plus there are apps not on the play store that just exist as they follow googles policy  like revanced and many more  this point is androids 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i disagree on giving the point to apple for the apps  but the rest i agree with  i feel like that claim of the lack of optimization for android apps is an old idea  at least with regard to big companies like samsung  i see you showed the optimization issue with the pixel fold in the video  but that isnt even a close representation to what happens most of the time  if you open the same apps that didnt work on the pixel fold  almost every single one works flawlessly on the galaxy fold 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphones are kinda boring so i am less distracted from my work after switching to ios 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,another great video   lol  i was on edge a little here   all about android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i eat apples and i poop it out  android the future is friendly
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,but those cameras  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot to add price which makes it a tie in between apple and android   for me using google home  chromecast  ipad for streaming netflix and gaming  pixel  for daily use and windows laptop is perfect   one drive can be used on all these platforms for file sharing and didnt had any issues living with it    not too much salt nor hot 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,marques lip lick counter hit  in this video xd
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,most people i know with an iphone  use a windows computer  here i am with an m macbook air  an ipad pro  and a google pixel smartphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,tkm marques gran video saludos desde cdmx
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,winking_face_with_tongue 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,its one company against s and its amazing one company can potentially beat s that are trying to  innovate 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you couldnt pay me to use apple   im not an institutionalized sheep  exorbitant 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,title of the video  samsung vs apple
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,but as an iphone user i am still feeling missing one of the option pause button to record a video as like in android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you do know that in asia  no one uses message and facetime right  put your american ego down
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,your background is amazing …  i know you are talking on cool stuffs about both phones but your background cut my eye 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no one  and i mean literally no one  outside the us  cares about imessage and facetime  also the ecosystem of apple is an expensive one  you can benefit from an android ecosystem with much less investment
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im an android guy  and have been for years   in my opinion  you can do a lot more with android than you can with iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’ve been selling these phones for almost  years and i’m telling you now apple is dummy proof because most people don’t actually know how to do half the things their phones do nor do they care  i can sell a boomer an iphone and they will not bother me for the next three months trying to figure out how to work it if they already had an iphone and transferring information is a million times easier than android for the masses  iphone just works it’s stamped the same for everybody and it’s dummy proof everything backs up to one account  you don’t need a gmail and a samsung account and a microsoft one account  just a back up some damn pictures and contacts   you have one account icloud  also you can’t go in there messing things up which is better for the masses  but if you’re techy and know how to manage your device go with an android  if somebody has problems with her phone  it takes like three things for me to figure out what it is wrong  an android phone  it could be endless trying to figure out what the customer did to their phone  samsung is the biggest hot mess of an os i’ve ever seen going from one samsung to the next one takes hours you can download one shit app and next thing you know barbara has  cleaning apps and  solitaire apps that have pop ups and ads on them and her phone can’t even pick up a phone call without malware popping up from some rogue solitaire game that android lets on its store  pixel is the closest thing  but samsung is the worst operating system hands down  not to mention the hardware there is iphone  plus an + is out there working perfectly fine with no issues  i’ve had at least three samsung s come in where they’re just dead ass nines dead ass eights that are slow and the battery is shot  pixels hardware is kind of junk to  you’ll be lucky to find a running pixel three out there  not many pixel fours either they all took a shit already  not to mention google is ran by communists so i went from a huge samsung and pixel fan to  i’m happy with an apple that just works and is going to last me at least five years 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,face_with_tears_of_joy 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have always had an iphone  but if it wasn’t for the ipad i would have an android   the ipad is such an amazing value in the tablet market and the  ecosystem  makes me stay with the iphone  i don’t like that fact but it is the way it is
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,for me  i have experience both worlds  and ios is like a beautiful lie and android are a customizable propaganda  android users makes their android devices look more like ios and ios are doing the same past few year  lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android phones are better in customization and having good features  the only downside in my opinion would be that android is own by google and it has been known that google collect much more data from users than from apple users 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i still think that youre way too biased towards apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,appstore vs playstore purchase cost is different in some countries  which can be major deciding factor for high spenders 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have both but tbh i use the iphone as a daily driver outside when i’m commuting  i mostly enjoy my android at home 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,they all do the same thing    i bought four iphones in a row in the early days of smart phones  then i got tired of buying the same phone over and over again when i switched to android i had a lot more fun buying a new phone because now i had so many options  my shopping experience was enhanced ten fold 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forget you can download apps from google directly onto   an android  which increases the number further this whole review process doesnt really take into account people with tech intelligence that can do way more on an android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i feel pricing needs to be a category here as apple products are usually much more expensive than an android counterpart 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,only thing i like about iphone is the build
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,love the j  cole nod
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,they are both good but there are glitches that happen on android that you will literally never run into on iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i had  pro max for a while   i also have google  pixel pro reason v why i got i got the google pixel  easy because the next couple of iphones are basically going to be the same thing   wanted to see how android changed last android i was almost yrs ago and both phones are still nothing special apple doesnt change much   android is the same with always needing constant updates
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,real winner  us
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone good for teen  work and status android good for advanced user  gamer and acessibility  without forgetting the compatibility of course  one of the things that android stands out the most  we dont use the adapter except to connect a pendrive  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,id give apps to android  if you know you know  everything else i agree with 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,laptop  macbook  phone android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,when i buy a phone the most important thing is being able to do anything i want with my device  so android it is  for my father who is technologically illiterate  there is no way in hell he could use an android  neat little list here  i would say it could use tweaking however  one of the biggest factors for android to me is being able to download any app i want  hell  i can make an app and use it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,lol  i go with android all day all year customization  features  apps android due to continuous supply of new and crazy apps that excite me   excitement  ease of use  ecosystem  for me its android  a the way  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,some people buy iphone just for the sake of showing off 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung phone to operate house appliances  iphone for the entertainment   work microsoft 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,this was hinted in the video but its kind of out of the scope of its theme  but im very interested in a class analysis of these two os’s  developers saying that they prioritize ios because theyll get more money out of it even though the majority of ppl use android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have never bought either phone   i have not bought a phone since    i refuse to be taken advantage of by planned obsolescence   apple being the most egregious offender of this parasitic business practice 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,in my country a lot of use using iphone but hardly any of them uses imessage or facetime
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,always an android user  a year ago bought a ipad and there is no far comparison  ios is much much better overall  now i’m inclined to buy an iphone to replace my samsung splus  i would love to say android is better  it would be much cheaper  but the truth is  no it is not 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you are going through this analysis you are +  of the time going to pick an android  not because android is better  but because this is an engineers type of analysis  and the vast majority of people that analyze things this way are going to be tech forward  experimental  diy types  who are mostly going to care about features and customizability more than anything  they are also more likely to use pcs and linux and other non apple products for the sand reason  but they are also a minority of android users  most people care about three things when buying a phone  price  camera  and compatibility  the last thing is most concerned with what youve already got  if you have a macbook and an ipad and all that  the iphone is going to be more valuable  if you are a creative you are probably using apple products because they tend to be much better for art and editing and things like that  so they are going to get an iphone regardless of all of those other factors  i enjoyed the video  i just felt like it was important to point out that in the year of our lord   people are clicking on this video to see if there can find another expert to agree with them in the neverending cell phone platform culture war than to actually figure out which one they want  i think it would be interesting to talk about who switches and why they switch though  theres probably some good insights there
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,had to give a soft  win  to apple users before saying its really up to you  so that their feelings dont get hurt hahaha
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,best os is the one that can used revanced 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i bought rhe  pro max  after a week i tooknit back and got thr s uktra  rje camera sicked on iphone  not being able to set the phone up to do what i want it to    i feel like this had to add categories spwcifically to make apple cone out equal  android ia a just flat out better  ios is nice  no doubt  but compared to a proper and high end android phone  ios isnt built for the users choice  its built to twll you how to use it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple share owned by vanguard and blackrock  the same goes for android  it’s all just fake competition  doesn’t matter 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android  samsung  just offers the whole package  and the deals are great 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i miss using the nokia   i had hopes for windowsos  but too many unregulated apps
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung ecosystem>>>apple ecosystem  look at how many equipment samsung has that can be connected to each other  compared to apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video  only issue i have is one statement   because apple stores are everywhere  here i am over  hours away from the nearest apple store lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,but the apple camera  you cant open it as fast as on an android  ease of use  nah  its also cause apple doesnt let you do it your way  so  it seems easier because apple doesnt allow you to try anything else  you get used to being told what to do  not easier  just trapped 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i have to disagree on th  th  and th categories            th  updates  when it comes to the updates for the actual os  apple might have the advantage  but when it comes to app updates  because all app updates have to go through qc  they can sometimes lag behind google   sometimes that lag can be long  even for critical vulnerabilities which should be patched asap   that point kind of bleeds over to the th category     as for the th category  ecosystem  you didnt even include all of googles ecosystem  you focused on samsung for reasons i am unsure of  unless it was only to give apple the advantage   no mention of nest doorbells  security camera  wi fi router  smoke   co alarm  door lock  thermostat   these devices all work natively with any android via either android home or nest apps and apple has nothing they make that would compete with these   if youre going to include ecosystem  then include all of the ecosystem  not what just one of the manufactures  samsung  has   why is there no mention of google  you know  the company who makes their phone without any bloatware  to counter your point of  never any bloatware loaded onto the iphone  ever   last point  this isnt even a good comparison video   youre comparing a phone  the iphone  to an os  android   there is only one iphone  but multiple android forks   either compare ios to stock android  from google  not another companies fork  or compare apple to google 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,he does a comparison  weeks before the  why 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,samsung is the red pill iphone is the blue pill …
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,wha t about privacy and security 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,to me apple is boring  i would never get an iphone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,budget friend   best bang for the buck = android  i am using a   poco x pro for yrs and  mos  man this phone has everything i need  i will be using this till it dies    p s  i dont hate iphone  its my dream phone  but what i hate are broke ass people   minimum wage who still go for iphone then goes on with their broke ass life cutting their budget for food and other important needs and also having debts for iphones 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, excitement  lol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,do you hate iphones 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,not surprised he picked iphone  again  just like it wasnt surprising when he picked iphone for best camera even after his own blind test with m votes picked the pixel a   still  hes the probably the closest thing to a  fair  apple fanboy ive seen  so theres that
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i miss the honey nut cheerios in the background
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i cant believe you missed the most important aspect  the price point 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,no serious buyer should take his comment seriously    most of what he says is purchase decision  i love iphones and if you love foldable  you choose android  period  the rest you live with   the  technology  reviewers  keep writing crap as they have a myopic view of the world   customisation gets a  point weightage  i don’t care about changing the icon every  weeks  i use my phone for some serious stuff    as i am typing this  i have a flight to catch and i know that i can leave my laptop behind as my files are synched to my phone   tablet for the meeting    i just returned a samsung flip   exciting  but didn’t fit my use cases for the cover display 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,to be honest  to the basic user  there isnt much of a difference between the two 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,iphone need to bring back the fingerprint unlock  face unlock is a pain in ass sometimes  iphone low light camera will always be inferior 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot the security topic
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,features that i absolutely love on android and really miss on apple are     mobile data detail view   consumption   swipe to call message from phonebook   file manager   quick charging   higher refresh rate for cheaper models
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive been on both sides  honestly just get both lolol
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ive got to say  before ease of use came up  i was having flashbacks to april fools with the samsung galaxy s ultra  and as someone who tried out an iphone  pro on his way from the galaxy s to the galaxy s  i disagree with the ease of use winner  its only easy if youve never used anything else  if you try multitasking or downloading a file from your onedrive to edit in excel and submit to your schools website   example of many  youre wasting your time if youre not on android     in the end  i still agree with the method  this is how everyone should learn to make difficult decisions 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dayum   to  for android for me  i guess thats why i simply cant decide ^^
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,dont give the apps category to apple when theyre shady as hell with all that  slowing phones down  so youll upgrade  naaa that aint cool
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,most of what is great about android doesn’t matter for serious users    i bought a flip  and gave it up in  days to get back to iphone pm  this is a cycle every   years and never feel android to be well stitched + secure   i am a senior technology professional who still codes 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,being an android user forever i cant stand using iphones  they just arent intuitive for me
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342, we still comparing 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video i simply love android because of customization and features 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i agree with you   i am all for android but i have and iphone because i married into to it  my wife have an android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well android overall is a better experience  i had iphone for many years until i switched to s ultra  the difference in what i experience is quite significant because iphone was a boring device  i cant understand why the  us is so passionate about imessage and facetime  in europe we barely use it  i never used it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,booo  we all know its iphone  just say it 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,well done lol 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,focus mode is on my galaxy s and it is way advanced 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,face time and imessage is shit everywhere else
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple as ecosystem winner  d and apps  i see way more apps reload on my iphone than on my android phone 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im   android user but i own apple shares and i hope people keep buying apple stuff  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,ios — you still cant delete anything from the app while your in it  deleting wallpaper you have to go to the lockscreen to delete it  you cant do it in the wallpaper’s app  absolutely a  backward— 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,funny  i hate apple and everything they are  android speaks to me  thought i have my own issues with google as well  yet  i can stay away from iphone  and it’s the platform  primarily imessage  facetime  and airdrop  i know there are similar services  though facetime has proven to be the highest quality video chat platform for me  but those alternative services don’t have the people  they don’t have my people and therefore might as well not exist  i have a pixel i bought to supplement my iphone  but it also overhears way too easy and is unusable where i live…
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,comments should have been turned off for this one 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple does nothing for me outside of imessage 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,about app section  i dont think ease of update for developers is more relevant than the number of apps   in the context of what is best for the actual user of the phone  this section should have been tie  not to mention that android supports  apk files which opens a whole new world of apps 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,buy both and stop sweating abouth things that doesnt matter  i couldnt care less about customization  i dont want my icons look like pokemons  i am not 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you cannot title this video the real winner and then be like its subjective >>>> 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,apple getting harder and harder to root for
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if you say ios you are talking about apple also  so to compare with android need to consider a supporting company too  then we will basically comparing brands 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,only important comment  there are more than  billion android users and more  billion ios users in the world   
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,trouble on ecosystem is that you compared apple to samsung  not to android  if you are on android out of samsung brand  you are out in the wild in this category 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the lack of a bitten apple on the back of my phone  has made me an android user l  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,id say android still wins on the apps category due to apks
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the fact it’s almost literally ios vs the world i gotta give it to apple for holding that ground against the many  many almost endless amount of android devices   well done apple 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,an excellent video  marques  i love android  my samsung galaxy s ultra gb smartphone because i love customizing my samsung galaxy s ultra smartphone with cool themes  i know how to use my android my smartphone  i dont like iphone because they all are the same  you cant customize them as much as you can on android samsung smartphones  thank you  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,the real winner is the people who don’t debate on which phone is better
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you must put weightage to each categories based on  importance 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i’m so tired of this apple vs android argument   as long as the phone works who gives a damn what it is   everything is so good these days i feel like you really gotta be nitpicking to find issues with any flagship device 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,im not a fanboy  i use both but i personally prefer android 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot dex is a huge advantage for the samsung ecosystem
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,so the take away is iphone won  what else is new
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,great video but in my opinion repaiability is much more important than excitement
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,hi mkbhd  i really think you should pay a visit to nigeria  we have an exciting young and exciting tech community over her   i can bet you that the use  and popularity of  face time and imessage on ifphones over here will very well compete with the us   on an average a youth that uses an android in nigeria also has an iphone nearby as the main  
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you work for both but you like android the most but apple pays you more money 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,today  my brother sent me a picture from his iphone  to my google pixel  so i could quickly use magic eraser to remove an object  i think that says a lot 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,you forgot to mention that you frequently need the newest gen apple devices across the board to access any ecosystem synergy features  have a slightly older iphone  none of the new features will work  slightly older mac  they stop even security updates after  years on some models now  even facetime stopped working across generations a while back  so i switched to whatsapp 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,price also is l for iphone too
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,android all day
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,pfffffffft  android user 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,axeept it the dynamic island is a gimmicy way to hide the notch  its just a notification center
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,i dont really know we can say ease of use is a good one  because even though i watch your videos and videos on iphone when someone gives me theres i cant use it  ive grown up with samsung same can happen vise versa 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,developers favor the iphone because its users on average spend more money  thats why they prioritize ios  not because its easier  developing on ios is worse 
nHkKJ87FS6s,iPhone vs Android (The Real Winner)!,223919,20342,if google could have aced it with chromeos and made it more towards developers engineers  then the whole ecosystem and even the market in the us could have shifted
